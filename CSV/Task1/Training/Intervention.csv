We did not include studies that compared different doses of one anti‐VEGF treatment against another, studies that included no control or comparator group, or studies that used anti‐VEGF agents in combination with other treatments. We did not include studies of aflibercept (VEGF Trap‐Eye/EYLEA solution) or studies that compared different treatment schedules (e.g. monthly vs as needed dosing), because other Cochrane reviews have evaluated these interventions (Li 2016; Sarwar 2016).","Primary outcomes The primary outcome for this review was based on best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at one‐year follow‐up. All included RCTs randomized only one eye per participant (i.e. the study eye); therefore we defined the primary outcome for the comparison of treatments as the proportion of participants who gained 15 or more letters (three lines) of BCVA in the study eye when BCVA was measured on a visual acuity chart with a LogMAR scale. Secondary outcomes Visual acuity outcomes Proportion of participants who gained 15 or more letters of BCVA in the study eye as measured at two‐year follow‐up Proportion of participants who lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at one year and at two years Proportion of participants who lost fewer than 30 letters of visual acuity at one year and at two years Proportion of participants for whom blindness was avoided in the study eye, defined as eyes with visual acuity better than 20/200 at one year and at two years Proportion of participants maintaining visual acuity, defined as a gain of zero or more letters (i.e. no loss of BCVA from baseline) at one year and at two years Mean change in visual acuity from baseline to one year and to two years Other secondary outcomes Contrast sensitivity, reading speed, or any other validated measure of visual function as measured in the included studies Assessment of morphologic characteristics by fluorescein angiography or OCT, including mean change in size of CNV, mean change in size of total lesion, and mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) Quality of life measures, as assessed with any validated measurement scale Economic data, such as comparative cost analyses Ocular or systemic adverse outcomes Follow‐up We included only trials in which participants were followed for at least one year.

CD007868,Fluoride toothpastes of different concentrations for preventing dental caries,"To determine and compare the effects of toothpastes of different fluoride concentrations (parts per million (ppm)) in preventing dental caries in children, adolescents, and adults.","To determine and compare the effects of toothpastes of different fluoride concentrations (parts per million (ppm)) in preventing dental caries in children, adolescents, and adults.","We included studies comparing toothbrushing with a fluoride toothpaste with toothbrushing with another fluoride toothpaste of a different concentration or with a non‐fluoride toothpaste or no toothpaste. On the basis of fluoride concentrations of toothpastes in regular use, we proposed the following categories: 0 (parts per million (ppm)) fluoride (F) (non‐fluoride or placebo toothpaste) 250 ppm F 440 to 550 ppm F 1000 to 1250 ppm F 1450 to 1500 ppm F 1700 to 2200 ppm F 2400 to 2800 ppm F. There were no restrictions placed on the fluoride agents which could be used singly or in combination: sodium fluoride (NaF) sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP) stannous fluoride (SnF2) acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) amine fluoride (AmF). Toothpastes could be formulated with any compatible abrasive system. These included dicalcium phosphate, sodium metaphosphate, calcium carbonate, silica, zirconium silicate, or calcium pyrophosphate. There was no restriction on fluoride concentration (ppm), amount or duration of application, frequency of use, toothbrushing technique (including supervised toothbrushing), or post‐toothbrushing procedure. We excluded studies where the intervention group or both the intervention and control groups received any additional active agent or caries preventive measure (e.g. chlorhexidine agent, fluoride varnish application, fluoride mouthrinse) as part of the study in addition to the fluoride or placebo toothpaste. Studies where the intervention group alone received any additional potentially active agent in the toothpaste such as xylitol, triclosan, N‐lauroyl sarcosinate, and casein phosphopeptide‐amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) were excluded; studies where both the intervention group and comparator group received any additional potentially active agent in the toothpaste were included. This protocol change was instigated to reflect the change in toothpaste formulation since the initial review. Many types of toothpaste now combine the caries preventive benefit of fluoride with other therapeutic agents to control plaque (antibacterial agents), tartar, and gum disease. Studies where both the intervention and control groups included participants receiving additional measures as part of their routine oral care such as supervised brushing, fissure sealants, were included, as were studies that were undertaken in areas with fluoridation of the community water supply.","Primary outcomes Caries increment as measured by: change from baseline in the decayed, (missing), and filled surface or teeth index (D(M)FS/T), in all permanent teeth erupted at the start and erupting over the course of the study (dental caries is defined here as being clinically and radiologically recorded at the dentine level of diagnosis); change from baseline in the decayed, (missing/extraction indicated), and filled surface or teeth index (d(e/m)fs/t) in all primary teeth; change in the proportion of participants developing new caries. Where possible we extracted data on D(M)FS/T, d(e/m)fs/t, and the proportion of participants developing new caries. We acknowledged that the primary outcome of caries could be measured and reported in a number of different ways. To account for this, the choice of outcome followed an adapted version of the hierarchy presented in the earlier review (Walsh 2010): DFS/T data would be chosen over DMFS/T data, and these would be chosen over DS/T or FS/T data for 'all surface types combined' would be chosen over data for 'specific types' only data for 'all erupted and erupting teeth combined' (E + U) would be chosen over data for 'erupted' (E) only, and these over data for 'erupting' (U) only data for dentinal/cavitated caries lesions (D3 level) would be chosen over data for enamel/non‐cavitated lesions (D1 level) net caries increment data would be chosen over crude (observed) increment data data from 'clinical and radiological examinations combined' would be chosen over data from 'clinical' (cl) only, and these over 'radiological' (xr) only. We defined clinical examinations as an examination using visual or tactile methods or both (VT) using a conventional lighting source. We excluded studies reporting caries using a non‐clinical examination alone (e.g. electronic caries monitor, quantitative light‐induced fluorescence) follow‐up nearest to 3 years (often the one at the end of the study period) would be chosen over all follow‐up. Clinical and radiographic examinations provided the definition of different stages or grades of caries lesions. These have been grouped into two basic grades for each method of examination. Clinical: non‐cavitated incipient enamel lesions clinically visible as white spots or discoloured fissures (NCA); lesions showing loss of enamel continuity that can be recorded clinically (undermined enamel, softened floor, walls) or showing frank cavitation (CA). Radiographic: any radiolucency in enamel/enamel‐dentine junction (ER); radiolucency into dentine (DR). Secondary outcomes Adverse effects such as irritation, dental staining/discolouration, etc.","Children, adolescents or adults, irrespective of the initial level of dental caries, background exposure to fluoride, receipt of dental treatment, nationality, setting where the intervention was received or age at recruitment to the trial.

CD012347,Psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,available in English Español To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,available in English Español To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,"Comorbidities As long as a comorbidity was not the primary focus, we included studies with participants with comorbid chronic physical conditions (e.g. hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, asthma), comorbid mental disorders (e.g. anxiety), or both. For example, we did not include interventions where anxiety was the primary focus.","Setting All types of settings were eligible for inclusion, e.g. inpatient (psychiatric setting, inpatient treatment for COPD), outpatient, and primary care.","Participant characteristics We included studies involving adults, 40 years of age and older, of either gender, and of any ethnicity. As most people with COPD begin experiencing COPD symptoms in their 40s, it is unlikely that individuals under 40 years of age would be diagnosed with clinically significant COPD (WHO 2018). Diagnosis As per protocol, studies were eligible to be included in this review if the participants were diagnosed with COPD (FEV1/FVC less than 70% predicted) and a recognised depressive disorder (or depressive symptoms) at the time of recruitment to the trial – assessed using standardised diagnostic criteria, or a formal, validated instrument (i.e. a questionnaire), or both. Considering that trials testing effectiveness of psychological therapies often apply diagnostic criteria for depression after randomisation and at baseline assessment (i.e. participants are not included in the trial on the basis of having a depressive diagnosis or depression symptoms), we allowed inclusion of these studies as well. The COPD diagnosis must have been made by a medical professional, clinically, or by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, or both (WHO 2018). Depression diagnostic criteria included, but were not limited to, DSM‐3, DSM‐4 (APA 2000), DSM‐5 (APA 2013). Comorbidities As long as a comorbidity was not the primary focus, we included studies with participants with comorbid chronic physical conditions (e.g. hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, asthma), comorbid mental disorders (e.g. anxiety), or both. For example, we did not include interventions where anxiety was the primary focus. Setting All types of settings were eligible for inclusion, e.g. inpatient (psychiatric setting, inpatient treatment for COPD), outpatient, and primary care. Subset data As per protocol, studies containing subsets of eligible participants were permitted, providing 60% of the study population had clinically diagnosed COPD and a depressive disorder. However, participants with clinically diagnosed COPD and a depressive disorder were the primary population in all of the studies included in this review.","All the studies included in this review are randomised controlled trials (RCTs); with one study being a cluster RCT.

We included interventions if the purpose was to improve uptake and adherence, or both uptake and adherence to contraception compared to standard delivery of care or another intervention. The included interventions fulfilled one of the following aims: improved uptake of contraception; promoted use of a specific contraceptive method; promoted uptake of more effective contraceptive methods; improved adherence to contraception; and both improved uptake and adherence to contraception. Interventions were included if they targeted current and potential contraception users. The authors definition of more effective contraceptive methods was accepted, although this was likely to include long‐acting reversible contraceptive methods. The interventions had to be delivered through named SNSs where the participant had a personal account that allowed them to access the intervention. Although not an exclusion criteria, SNSs were expected to allow participants to interact with each other. We excluded any intervention delivered by an application or website where a personal account was not required, where the intervention could only be utilised when downloaded, or if participants could not interact with the intervention directly. We included SNSs available in a downloadable form only if they also had an open‐access website.","Primary outcomes Contraception use (for at least three months postintervention), which included: initiation of a new method; increased uptake of more effective methods; improved adherence to a method; and both increased uptake and improved adherence. Contraception use was be assessed in various ways, and we accepted the method used by the trial investigator. The time frame for assessment was three months or more for the initiation of a new method and improved adherence of an existing method as defined by the study. Secondary outcomes Change in attitude or knowledge about contraception. Attitudes towards the use of SNSs as an intervention.","Women of reproductive age who may have initiated contraceptive use, switched to a different method or continued to use the same method. Reproductive age was defined as between 15 and 49 years of age as per the World Health Organization (WHO) definition (WHO 2006). In studies that included both sexes, we requested results pertaining to women from the authors. Postpartum or postabortal women were also included.","We considered interventional studies including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised interventional studies (NRS) to include non‐RCTs. We expected limited evidence from RCTs that utilised an SNS as an intervention. Thus, we included NRS to examine the evidence base broadly.","[23079168, 26472349, 28939582, 12840864]",[23079168]

We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment; if ICS was administered in combination with LABA prior to the trial, participants should be transitioned to the equivalent ICS monotherapy prior to study start. The effect of continued ICS use was planned to be examined by subgroup analysis (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).","Primary outcomes All‐cause mortality. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) of any cause. Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Respiratory Health‐related Quality of Life (HRQoL), as measured by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). Comments about primary outcomes Serious adverse events SAEs can include death, life‐threatening adverse reaction, hospitalisation or increased length of hospital stay, disability, and birth defects. We recorded each study's definition of an SAE if it varied from our definition. Respiratory health‐related quality of life CRQ and SGRQ are widely‐used, reliable and valid measures of patient‐reported health status in COPD (Guyatt 1987; Jones 1992). SGRQ scores three domains of health status (symptoms, patient activity, and disease impact), and reports scores ranging from zero (best) to 100 (worst). The Minimally Clinical Important Difference (MCID) is approximately four (Schunemann 2003). That is, a clinically meaningful change in health status is equal to a change of about four points on SGRQ. CRQ scores four domains (shortness of breath, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery), reports scores ranging from one (worst) to seven (best), and has an MCID of 0.5 (Schunemann 2005). While CRQ and SGRQ provide very similar information and are highly correlated, SGRQ is less responsive; it was shown to underestimate treatment effects when compared to CRQ in identical populations (Puhan 2006). Thus, pooling SGRQ data with CRQ data may spuriously suggest heterogeneity of treatment effect. Therefore, SGRQ and CRQ were considered as separate outcomes; this approach agrees with the recommendations of Puhan 2006, who suggest that mean differences for SGRQ and CRQ should be reported separately. Acute exacerbations of COPD We included AECOPD as a main outcome because exacerbations are consistently linked to mortality, morbidity, and costly hospitalisations. Since a consensus definition and standard reporting criteria do not exist for AECOPD (Cazzola 2008), we performed a meta‐analysis of AECOPD data only when study authors used one of the following definitions: increase in symptoms precipitating the use of antibiotics; increase in symptoms precipitating the use of systemic steroids; increase in symptoms precipitating emergency room visit; or hospitalisation. The MCID for AECOPD outcomes is not established: Calverley 2005 estimated an MCID of 20% to 25% using a crude anchor‐based approach, while Chapman 2013 used an expert consensus process to estimate an MCID of 11%. Secondary outcomes Trough (pre‐dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1). Peak (post‐dose) FEV1. Six‐minute walking test (6MWT). Adverse effects. Comments about secondary outcomes Forced expiratory volume FEV1 is the volume of air forcibly exhaled one second after maximum inhalation. FEV1 is often used for staging COPD (GOLD 2017): FEV1 is 20% lower than normal for patients with mild COPD and 70% lower than normal for patients with very severe COPD. FEV1 is also used to assess treatment effect. However, the MCID for FEV1 has not been quantitatively established (expert opinion proposes an MCID of 100 mL to 140 mL) (Cazzola 2008). Moreover, FEV1 is an intermediate endpoint, representing airflow as a surrogate for clinically important outcomes. Surrogate outcomes are not patient‐centred. Nevertheless, we included trough FEV1 because one meta‐analysis points to a modest correlation between increased trough FEV1 and improved SGRQ (Westwood 2011). For the purpose of this review we will consider the MCID for FEV1 to be 100 mL (Donohue 2005). Six‐minute walking test In the ECLIPSE study (a non‐interventional cohort study of treated COPD patients), one‐year change in 6MWT predicted death in the subsequent 12 months. The mean between‐group change between survivors and non‐survivors was 30 metres (95% CI 26 to 34). Using these results, Polkey 2013 proposed an MCID of about 30 metres.

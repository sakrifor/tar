CD007394,Galactomannan detection for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients,"Our primary objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in serum for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, at different cut-off values for test positivity.","A commercially available galactomannan sandwich ELISA (Platelia©) was the test under evaluation. We only included studies concerning galactomannan detection in serum. We excluded studies addressing detection in BAL fluid, a number of other body fluids, such as CSF or peritoneal fluid, and tissue. We also excluded studies evaluating in-house serum galactomannan tests.","Our primary objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in serum for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, at different cut-off values for test positivity. Secondary objectives We aimed to study several possible sources of heterogeneity: subgroups of patients, different interpretations of the EORTC/MSG criteria as the reference standard and study design features.","The following reference standards can be used to define the target condition: autopsy; the criteria of the EORTC/MSG (Ascioglu 2002; De Pauw 2008); or the demonstration of hyphal invasion in biopsies, combined with a positive culture for Aspergillus species from the same specimens. The gold standard for this diagnosis is autopsy, combined with a positive culture of Aspergillus species from the autopsy specimens, or with histopathological evidence of Aspergillus. Autopsy is rarely reported, therefore we decided to take the criteria of the EORTC/MSG as the reference standard. These criteria divide the patient population into four categories: patients with proven invasive aspergillosis, patients who probably have invasive aspergillosis, patients who possibly have invasive aspergillosis and patients without invasive aspergillosis (see Table 1). This division is based on host factor criteria, microbiological criteria and clinical criteria. Clinical studies have shown that these criteria do not match autopsy results perfectly. This especially true for the possible category. For clinical trials investigating the effect of treatment, for example, it is recommended that only the proven and probable categories are used (Borlenghi 2007; Subira 2003). The exclusion of patients with 'possible' invasive aspergillosis, which can be regarded as group of 'difficult or atypical' patients, is likely to affect the observed diagnostic accuracy of a test. Also, the exclusion of any other of the reference standard groups may affect the accuracy of the index test. We therefore excluded studies explicitly excluding one of the four categories of patients from the review, as well as studies in which it is not clear how many patients with proven, probable, possible or no invasive aspergillosis had positive or negative index test results.","The target condition of this review was invasive aspergillosis, also called invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or systemic aspergillosis.","Studies had to include patients with neutropenia or patients whose neutrophils are functionally compromised. We included studies with the following patient groups: patients with haematological malignancies, receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants, chemotherapeutics or immunosuppressive drugs; solid organ transplant recipients and other patients who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs for a prolonged time; patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapeutics; patients with a medical condition compromising the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, an inherited abnormality of the neutrophils).","Studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection by the Platelia© sandwich ELISA test, with either prospective or retrospective data collection, were eligible. The galactomannan ELISA could be assessed alone or in comparison to other tests.","[24049291, 23644098, 23614624, 23508427, 23389933, 23369047, 22949309, 22732810, 22723171, 22631066, 22505446, 22385270, 22170907, 21811868, 21492228, 21429401, 21129281, 21108574, 21056109, 20952804, 20936913, 20825441, 20703324, 20367932, 20367931, 20156215, 20091935, 19838867, 19801584, 19659648, 19617902, 19576092, 19573449, 19549404, 19238113, 19198228, 19180751, 19139728, 19109479, 19005145, 18845828, 18703991, 18390117, 18331444, 18227109, 18055488, 17885264, 17650666, 17596794, 17446963, 17443470, 17394605, 17354292, 17326997, 17287156, 17205865, 17205662, 16797366, 16597909, 16453271, 16395687, 16175901, 16163633, 15983733, 15872239, 15686470, 15668862, 15634986, 15456368, 15456366, 15352990, 15243943, 15184460, 15114095, 15084177, 15059142, 14999641, 14766869, 12734275, 12716367, 12402199, 12010653, 11920178, 11919250, 11211181, 11180076, 10889818, 9636871, 9613784, 9279718, 8801086, 8586691]","[24049291, 23644098, 23389933, 23369047, 22949309, 22732810, 22723171, 22631066, 22505446, 22385270, 21811868, 21129281, 20367932, 20091935, 19617902, 19576092, 19573449, 18845828, 17446963, 17326997, 17287156, 17205865, 16797366, 16453271, 16395687, 16175901, 16163633, 15872239, 15686470, 15668862, 15456366, 15243943, 15184460, 15114095, 15059142, 14999641, 12734275, 12716367, 12402199, 12010653, 11920178, 11919250, 10889818, 9636871, 9613784]"
CD007427,"Physical tests for shoulder impingements and local lesions of bursa, tendon or labrum that may accompany impingement","To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of physical tests, applied singly or in combination, for shoulder impingements (subacromial or internal) or local lesions of bursa, rotator cuff or labrum that may accompany impingement, in people whose symptoms and/or history suggest any of these disorders. We also examined the physical tests according to whether they were intended to: identify impingement in general (or differentiate it from other causes of shoulder pain, e.g. 'frozen shoulder') subcategorise impingement as subacromial outlet impingement (impingement under the acromion process) or internal impingement (impingement within the shoulder joint) diagnose lesions of bursa, tendon or glenoid labrum that may be associated with impingement form part of a diagnostic package or process and, if so, according to the stages at which they may apply. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity. Study population: older general population; young athletic population; other well defined groups e.g. wheelchair users or swimmers (see the Differences between protocol and review) Stage of clinical care: primary (generally in the community setting), secondary (referral following preliminary screening) or tertiary (referral to a specialist centre) Study design: cross sectional (or cohort) versus case-control; retrospective versus prospective design Type of reference test. This will vary according to the target condition and setting, but generally surgery versus non-invasive imaging will be considered (seeTable 3) Aspects of study conduct, specifically: blinding and reporting of uninterpretable or intermediate results.","Physical tests used singly or in combination to identify shoulder impingement, such as the painful arc test (Cyriax 1982); to classify shoulder impingements, e.g. Neer’s test (Neer 1977; Neer 1983), the modified relocation test (Hamner 2000), the internal rotation resistance strength test (Zaslav 2001); or to diagnose localised conditions that may accompany impingement, e.g. Yergason’s test (Yergason 1931), the lift off test (Gerber 1991a; Gerber 1996; Hertel 1996a), the crank test (Liu 1996b), the active compression test (O'Brien 1998a) and the biceps load II test (Kim 2001) (see Table 1). Ideally, articles for inclusion should have described a physical test, or reference a source that did so, in sufficient detail to enable its replication, and clearly indicate what constituted a positive index test result. Those that did not were included only if they provided sufficient information to be of clinical value. Studies reporting the collective diagnostic accuracy of a series of tests were considered, providing each component, and its manner of inclusion, were adequately described. Generic terms such as 'physical examination', as used to denote an unspecified combination of physical tests, led to exclusion unless further details were obtained from authors.","To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of physical tests, applied singly or in combination, for shoulder impingements (subacromial or internal) or local lesions of bursa, rotator cuff or labrum that may accompany impingement, in people whose symptoms and/or history suggest any of these disorders.

We additionally considered ultrasound, which may be conducted in the primary care setting, and magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance arthrography, subacromial local anaesthesia, arthrography and bursography, all of which may have more general applicability than surgery. These additional ‘reference’ tests are defined in Table 3. Their validity varies according to context, and are discussed case by case (see Table 3).","Subacromial or internal impingement of the shoulder and the localised conditions that may accompany these classifications, namely bursitis, rotator cuff tears, glenoid labrum tears, and inflammation or rupture of the biceps tendon. Instability may underlie impingement, but tests of instability were only included if they were intended to demonstrate associated impingement pain, as in the modified relocation test (Hamner 2000), as opposed to instability per se. Similarly, tests for ACJ disorders were only included if, like the active compression test (O'Brien 1998a), they had a component intended to reproduce impingement pain.","Patients of any age and in any clinical setting with pain, dysfunction or both suspected to be due to shoulder impingement of any type (see Target conditions), whether subacromial, internal or secondary to rotator cuff disease, and with or without rotator cuff tears. Excluded were studies evaluating physical (index) tests under anaesthesia, or intra- or post-operatively. We also excluded studies that focused solely on pain due to acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) disorders; or that focused primarily on shoulder joint instability, fracture, acute or recurrent shoulder dislocation, or systemic disease (e.g. rheumatoid disease). Subsequent to the protocol we excluded studies with highly selected populations, such as overhead throwing athletes. After evaluation of a patient’s history, physical tests are normally the first stage in the diagnosis of shoulder impingement. However, the applicability of one physical test may be conditional upon the result of another (e.g. Zaslav 2001), and this was taken into account.","We considered diagnostic test accuracy studies that directly compared the accuracy of one or more physical index tests for shoulder impingement against a reference test. We considered diagnostic test accuracy studies with cross-sectional or cohort designs (retrospective or prospective), case-control studies and randomised controlled trials. In particular, we noted whether the cases and controls in case-control studies were highly selected or acceptably representative of the patient population normally tested by the index test(s). We considered, but decided against, excluding cohort studies with an excessively long period between the index and reference test. We defined this as a period that, on average, equals or exceeds the reported mean duration of symptoms, or one month (whichever is shorter). We excluded studies that were reported only in abstract form.","[19230608, 19181972, 19059895, 19059801, 18996735, 18838403, 18456541, 18329943, 19083717, 19064153, 19064147, 18721119, 18555732, 18523035, 18515961, 18503815, 18442680, 18412933, 18375403, 18357656, 18320379, 18308183, 18006674, 17932402, 17720798, 17728506, 17665351, 17620810, 17504318, 17504312, 17478654, 17461398, 17279037, 17210430, 17179786, 17148619, 17027405, 16958437, 16943859, 16915978, 16822450, 16735587, 16493175, 16357549, 16219944, 16219939, 16282408, 16226652, 16210463, 16171635, 16148361, 16127127, 16002494, 16000664, 15966539, 15866244, 15839306, 15773565, 15674840]","[18503815, 18320379, 18006674, 17478654, 17027405, 16943859, 16219944, 16219939]"
CD008054,Human papillomavirus testing versus repeat cytology for triage of minor cytological cervical lesions,"For studies where both triage methods, i.e. repeat cytology and the HC2 assay, were assessed: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of triage with HC2 and with repeat cytology to detect underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), or grade 3 or worse (CIN3+), in women with an index smear showing ASCUS (triage group I) or LSIL (triage group II), and to compare the accuracy of both triage methods.","The index test was the B probe of the HC2 assay, which detects DNA of 13 hrHPV types (see Index test(s)). For the main meta-analysis on the accuracy of triage with HC2, the review authors only considered the standard cut-off of test positivity as defined by the manufacturer. This standard cut-off of test positivity corresponds with a light signal of the test sample equivalent to that of a positive control containing 1 pg/mL of HPV DNA (RLU = 1).","Main objective For studies where both triage methods, i.e. repeat cytology and the HC2 assay, were assessed: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of triage with HC2 and with repeat cytology to detect underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), or grade 3 or worse (CIN3+), in women with an index smear showing ASCUS (triage group I) or LSIL (triage group II), and to compare the accuracy of both triage methods. Secondary objectives To assess the accuracy of the HC2 assay to detect CIN2+ or CIN3+ in women with ASCUS or LSIL in a larger group of studies that investigated hrHPV testing, irrespective whether repeat cytology was done. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity The following sources of heterogeneity were investigated: Different cytological classification systems used to categorise equivocal and mild cytological abnormalities. Characteristics of the study population (study location, age distribution). Properties of the HPV testing (collection device, transport medium). Properties of repeat cytology (collection device, preparation method (conventional or liquid-based), cytological thresholds). Blinding of interpreters for other test results. Procedures of reference standard verification.","The following reference standards were considered as acceptable for judging on presence or absence of the target condition: colposcopy and colposcopy‐directed punch biopsies or excision biopsies by large loop excision of the transformation zone or conization, with or without endocervical curettage, followed by histological verification of the biopsy specimen. Cases where no biopsy was taken, because colposcopy was negative and satisfactory, were considered as being free of CIN2+.","Target conditions Presence of histologically-confirmed high-grade CIN was the target outcome of disease. Two separate outcomes were distinguished: CIN2 or worse disease (CIN2, CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN2+)); CIN3 or worse (CIN3, invasive squamous cervical cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (CIN3+)). CIN3 is the most relevant clinical outcome, since it is considered to be an obvious precursor of cervical cancer, whereas CIN2 is a mixed condition that is less reproducible, with a lower probability of progression to cervical cancer. However, the outcome CIN2+ is reported more often than CIN3+.

CD008081,Optical coherence tomography (OCT) for detection of macular oedema in patients with diabetic retinopathy,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for detecting DMO and CSMO, defined according to ETDRS 1985, in patients referred to ophthalmologists after DR is detected. In the update of this review we also aimed to assess whether OCT might be considered the new reference standard for detecting DMO.","The index test was OCT, regardless of the generation of development of the instrument (low or high resolution, three-dimensional or spectral-domain OCTs). Despite the fact that retinal thickness measurements with OCT have been compared to those obtained with the Retinal Thickness Analyzer in at least one study (Goebel 2006), based on our knowledge we believe that such a comparison is no longer of interest given the dominant use of OCT devices. We are not aware of any other instruments that can be compared to OCT.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for detecting DMO and CSMO, defined according to ETDRS 1985, in patients referred to ophthalmologists after DR is detected. In the update of this review we also aimed to assess whether OCT might be considered the new reference standard for detecting DMO. Secondary objectives 1) Heterogeneity investigation To determine which retinal thickness cut-off or which OCT algorithm yields the best diagnostic performance. In fact, clinicians may use different thresholds of retinal thickness to define DMO and CSMO. Furthermore, thickness can be calculated using different algorithms (such as, previously, central point thickness or, currently, central subfield thickness, which were found to be highly correlated in DRCR Network 2008) or other algorithms that try to detect paracentral retinal thickening (Sadda 2006). Based on a previous systematic review on this topic, conducted by some of the authors (Virgili 2007), we initially planned to investigate the following sources of clinical heterogeneity. A. Heterogeneity related to retinal thickness cut-off We originally planned to explore which cut-off value of central retinal thickness represents the best trade-off of sensitivity and specificity for clinical use. We selected only two pre-planned cut-offs because data driven cut-off selection has been found to lead to optimistic estimates of sensitivity and specificity, especially in small studies (Leeflang 2008). Based on the Virgili 2007 review, we expected to report on a sensitive and a specific threshold, corresponding to values of 250 µm and 300 µm (± 25 µm for both cut-offs). However, only one study reported both thresholds and we used the available information as explained later in the review. Furthermore, the calibration of different OCT devices was found to vary, making the effect of using a specific threshold inconsistent (Wolf-Schnurrbusch 2009). B. Heterogeneity related to index test Which OCT definition of CSMO should be preferred, such as using the central thickness subfield or complex diagnostic algorithms? What is the difference between OCT models of different generations which were found to yield different measurements (Forooghian 2008; Kiernan 2009; Wolf-Schnurrbusch 2009)? C. Heterogeneity related to reference standard What is the impact of the type of reference standard used, i.e. stereophotography, contact or non-contact lens biomicroscopy? D. Heterogeneity related to characteristics of the study population What is the performance of OCT in higher versus lower prevalence studies? (Taking into account that we planned to include clinic-based series, a level of prevalence around 30% was considered a priori.) E. Heterogeneity related to methodological study quality items See Appendix 1 of the QUADAS 2 checklist (Whiting 2011) which replaced QUADAS (Whiting 2003) in the update of this review. We dichotomised QUADAS 2 items using yes versus other categories and planned to use a Risk of Bias or Applicability as covariate if the smaller subgroup included at least three studies. 2) To assess whether OCT might be considered the new reference standard The updated version of this review included an introductory section on the clinical pathways and the role of the index test, which is now a mandatory item in RevMan 2012. The diagnostic accuracy framework is valid if the clinical reference standard is the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target (Bossuyt 2008) and implies that, in patients with discordant results, the reference standard is true and the index test is wrong. Diagnostic studies can take the ""agreement"" rather than the ""accuracy"" perspective to compare OCT and fundus examination, implying that neither test was believed to be more valid than the other. Browning 2008b; Ockrim 2010; Olson 2013 and Ontario HTA 2009 believed that OCT is more sensitive than clinical examination or stereoscopic fundus photography for the detection of retinal thickening. Lord 2006 and Lord 2009 advised that whenever clinicians use a new diagnostic test because it is more sensitive than an old test, they need to be clear about the assumptions linking this evidence to improved patient outcomes, such as evidence that the new test detects the same spectrum of disease as the old test, or that similar treatment efficacy exists across the spectrum of disease. Although this issue is not an aim of our review, and we did not try to systematically investigate it, it is clearly key in interpreting and using our results and will be discussed based on articles assessed during the preparation of this review, as well as their relevant references.","In the ETDRS study DMO was defined on the basis of stereoscopic fundus photography (ETDRS 1985). This technique is complicated and difficult to use in a clinical setting. It was replaced by contact fundus biomicroscopy, which was found to be in close agreement with stereophotography, particularly for CSMO (Kinyoun 1989). Non-contact fundus biomicroscopy is more commonly used, since sophisticated fundus lenses have been proposed for binocular fundus observation during the past two decades, yet it has been shown to be slightly less sensitive than contact fundus biomicroscopy in the study conducted by Browning et al (Browning 2004). When this review was conceived, we considered that valid reference tests were stereoscopic fundus photography and contact lens or non-contact lens biomicroscopy of the fundus. As reported above, in the update of this review, we acknowledge that OCT is increasingly thought of as a new reference standard for DMO (Olson 2013; Ontario HTA 2009) and will not update the review further. Although the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Preferred Practice Patterns (AAO PPP 2012) still considers clinical examination as the current recommendation for routine diagnosis of DMO, Schneider 2013 found that the use of OCT has greatly increased for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration or DMO in recent years, while that of fluorescein angiography or fundus photography has decreased.","Our review considered the target conditions as both the general definition of DMO and its most severe type, CSMO. In fact, finding the milder form of DMO still has implications regarding the need for closer follow-up as well as on visual prognosis (ETDRS 1985). The ETDRS definitions of DMO and CSMO were adopted in the original version of this review because these definitions have proven prognostic value and CSMO has represented for years the main indication for focal or grid laser photocoagulation (ETDRS 1985); although this treatment technique is less used with the advent of antiangiogenic therapy (Virgili 2014). The most common type of CSMO is the central type, defined as retinal thickening within 500 µm of the centre of the macula or, alternatively, hard exudates within 500 µm of the centre of the macula and with thickening of the adjacent retina. The non-central type of CSMO is less common and is defined as a zone of retinal thickening, one disc area or larger, any portion of which is located within one disc diameter from the centre of the macula. Anatomic lesions different from retinal thickening such as the presence of intraretinal cysts, retinal layer abnormalities (Alasil 2010; Yohannan 2013), or a thickened posterior vitreous surface adhering to the macula, which is better seen using OCT, have been suggested to be relevant features of DMO in OCT (Chan 2005). However, there is currently no widely accepted standard to define and report these clinical and OCT aspects and to relate them to the ETDRS definitions of DMO and CSMO, which rely on retinal thickening. Finally, we did not take into account the role of other biomicroscopic findings, including a thickened hyaloid, and their influence on the diagnostic performance of OCT in DMO patients.","Included participants were people referred to ophthalmologists because they had been found to have some level of DR, expectedly by primary care professionals, such as optometrists, diabetologists and general practitioners, or by other ophthalmologists. Prevalence is often an indicator of severity of disease spectrum in a study. If patients with any level of DR were examined, the prevalence of DMO would be expected to be lower than 10% (Williams 2004; Yau 2012). However, a relatively high prevalence of DMO was expected, as found in studies included in a previous systematic review (Virgili 2007) and conducted in retina practices, suggesting that a diagnosis of more severe DR, or even any DMO, had already been carried out in the study population.","We planned to include all prospective and retrospective consecutive series of patients and case-control studies that evaluated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing DMO. As discussed above, we acknowledge that the clinical pathway is unclear and may vary across settings and countries. Therefore, we accepted studies in which a two-by-two table was presented which crossed the results of OCT retinal thickness, dichotomised at the approximate thresholds of interest, with ophthalmologists' detection of DMO or CSMO by means of fundus biomicroscopy or photography as defined later. We recorded the settings in which patients were recruited and examined in each study.","[21996307, 9479300, 17502499, 18316700, 17063373, 20451897, 20484587, 11401636, 15802932, 19996821, 22952119, 10896351, 15051203, 12476103, 22872201, 16647123, 20530184, 15006844, 16799051, 11773037, 22323463, 12510717, 22137207, 10372879, 16395139, 19118697]","[21996307, 9479300, 17502499, 18316700, 15051203, 16647123, 20530184, 15006844, 11773037, 16395139]"

Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate heterogeneity in relation to the index test (by commercial test, test type and grouped by HRP-2/pLDH) and reference tests (microscopy vs PCR), as well as the study participants' age, endemicity of malaria, and geographic area (by continent).","Studies were required to diagnose P. falciparum malaria using at least one of the following two reference standards. Conventional microscopy of thick blood smears, thin blood smears or both. Presence of asexual P. falciparum parasites of any density was regarded as a positive smear. PCR test. We required that the reference standard was carried out on blood samples taken at the same time and from the same person as the index tests.

CD008587,Cytology versus HPV testing for cervical cancer screening in the general population,"The main objective of this review was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of HPV testing for detecting histologically confirmed CIN 2 or worse (CIN 2+), including adenocarcinoma in situ, in women participating in primary cervical cancer screening; and how it compares to the accuracy of cytological testing (liquid-based and conventional) at various thresholds.","Only HPV tests that are still currently used in clinical research practice were considered. These are: HC2 or newer improved signal amplification methods; PCR using the following primers GP5+/GP6+, MY09/11, SPF10, or CPI/II; Aptima (HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing); other techniques that were identified during the search process. For the HC2 method we considered two thresholds for the definition of a positive result: 1 pg/mL and 2 pg/mL; and for the other techniques the threshold used by the researchers.","The main objective of this review was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of HPV testing for detecting histologically confirmed CIN 2 or worse (CIN 2+), including adenocarcinoma in situ, in women participating in primary cervical cancer screening; and how it compares to the accuracy of cytological testing (liquid-based and conventional) at various thresholds. Secondary objectives Secondary objectives of the review were: to determine the accuracy for each test at prespecified thresholds and the accuracy of different HPV testing techniques; to investigate sources of heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies. As possible sources of heterogeneity we assessed the influence of the following covariates: the geographical location where the study was conducted, the age limits of the study population, the number of HPV types that the HPV test detects, and the likelihood of verification bias.","As a reference standard, we used the combination of colposcopy and histology. If colposcopy was normal, we did not require a histologic result for proof of absence of disease. If colposcopy was abnormal and a biopsy was taken, then we used the histologic result as the reference standard. We assumed that the histologic examination of material obtained by colposcopy-directed biopsy, loop excision or endocervical curettage provided complete assessment of the considered disease status. Colposcopy as a reference standard is a subjective examination and has low sensitivity for the detection of small CIN 3 lesions (Jeronimo 2006). On the other hand its performance in quality-assured settings is not at all insensitive for clinically important CIN 3. The ideal reference standard for the evaluation of a cervical screening test would be the excision of the whole transformation zone and its subsequent histopathological examination. Given that such a procedure in healthy women is ethically unjustifiable, due to its morbidity, studies have to rely on colposcopy with directed biopsies even with its limitations. In this review we included studies where the reference standard was used in one of three ways: applied to all women; applied to all women with a positive screening test and to a random sample of screen-negative women in order to correct for verification bias; restricted to those with a positive screening test. This last category of studies is prone to verification bias if the double test negatives are considered to be true negatives. However, verification bias will be limited when one of the screen tests is very sensitive. These studies can produce unbiased estimates of relative sensitivity and relative false positive rates (Arbyn 2009a; Schatzkin 1987).",Target conditions The target condition was high grade CIN 2 or worse. Some studies used the threshold of CIN 3. We included these in the review but analysed them separately.,"Women participating in a cervical cancer screening programme who were not being followed up for previous cytological abnormalities. The study population could not be part of a case-control design (with a predetermined proportion of known disease positives to known disease negatives). Rather, women had to form a consecutive series; they had to be recruited as a single group with their disease status being unknown at the time of recruitment.

We provided summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy for individual index tests to better understand the utility and limitations of these non-invasive tests.,"Any non‐ or minimally invasive test used to assess risk of CAD. These included:  Stress echocardiography (using either exercise or pharmacological stress, e.g. DSE)  MPS using either exercise or pharmacological stress  EST  EBCT  ECG  Conventional echocardiography  Exercise ventriculography  DSF  CIMT  Cardiopulmonary exercise testing  CT coronary angiography  Magnetic resonance angiography  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.  Information regarding the various index tests including the type of result produced, if cut‐off values were present, and how differences in cut‐off points were handled, is provided in Table 1.

Description of index tests Test Description Advantages Disadvantages Type of result Presence of cut‐off values Screening tests MPS  Stress  Exercise  dipyridamole  dobutamine  Radionucleotide  thallium‐201 or Tc‐99m sestamibi radionucleotide agents    This compares perfusion of myocardium at rest and after a ‘stress’ such as exercise or drugs (e.g. dipyridamole).   When coronary arteries are normal, ‘stress’ results in vasodilatation and increased coronary blood flow. However, diseased coronary arteries cannot dilate because they are already maximally dilated and there is no increase in blood flow after a stress. MPS reveals these areas as regions of decreased perfusion. A reversible perfusion defect is a sign of ischaemia. A fixed defect (when there is decreased perfusion before, during and after the stress) is an indicator of infarction.  Pharmacological agents overcome limitations of exercise testing in patients with kidney disease Non‐invasive  Provides information regarding functional status of myocardium under stress conditions Neither 100% sensitive nor specific  Radiation dose  Results subject to interpretation and reader bias  False positives due to increase in attenuation artefacts caused by left ventricular hypertrophy  False negatives due to balanced ischaemia (e.g. triple vessel disease)  More expensive than exercise ECG Dichotomous (i.e. stress test positive or stress test negative) None. However, whether a stress test is interpreted as positive or negative depends largely on observer interpretation DSE  Stress  Exercise  dobutamine Stress echocardiography compares the regional wall motion and thickness of myocardium both at rest and after stress. Regional systolic dysfunction is usually caused by CAD.

However, whether a stress test is interpreted as positive or negative depends largely on observer interpretation Exercise ECG  Bruce protocol stress ECG Patient exercises on a treadmill while connected to an ECG. The level of exercise is increased in progressive stages. The patient's symptoms and blood pressure response are checked repeatedly. Ischaemic ECG changes or angina symptoms brought on by exercise are highly suggestive of underlying CAD Non‐invasive  Provides information regarding functional status of myocardium under stress conditions Neither 100% sensitive nor specific  Results subject to interpretation and reader bias  Often limited by the inability of CKD patients to achieve an adequate peak exercise workload, development of exercise‐induced hypotension  High proportion have abnormal baseline ECG (left ventricular hypertrophy) Dichotomous (i.e. stress test positive or stress test negative) No. However, whether a stress test is interpreted as positive or negative depends largely on observer interpretation Coronary artery calcium score  EBCT  Multidetector computed tomography Cardiac calcium scoring is a non‐invasive test that uses computed tomography to detect the presence of calcium in plaque on the walls of the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries). A calcium score is then derived, calculated as a summation of all calcified lesions in the coronary arteries. The calcium score is then compared with a reference range appropriate to a patient's age and sex.

This will vary depending on the institution (e.g. 0.75 mm) Cardiopulmonary exercise testing Evaluates both cardiac and pulmonary function. Cardiac function is evaluated in terms of aerobic capacity and respiratory function.  The subject is exercised on a bicycle ergometer or treadmill. The test enables calculation of maximal aerobic capacity and the point during exercise where anaerobic metabolism is used to supplement aerobic metabolism as a source of energy.

We provided summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy for individual index tests to better understand the utility and limitations of these non-invasive tests. Secondary objectives We compared the diagnostic accuracy among different screening tests through: Direct comparison: By analysing the results of studies that assessed diagnostic accuracy of two or more tests in the same population head-to-head. Indirect comparison: By comparing the pooled results of studies that assessed accuracy of screening tests in separate populations.  The ability of screening tests to detect severe coronary artery stenosis (≥ 70% stenosis detected on coronary angiography) was also assessed and compared among different screening tests.  Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We also investigated if diagnostic accuracy varied among studies with different prevalence of symptomatic chest pain and analysed the effect. For this analysis, we included only studies that used a threshold of ≥ 70% stenosis on coronary angiography for the diagnosis of CAD. To avoid partial verification, we considered effects among study participants who underwent both the index test and coronary angiography. This methodology meant that we were able to avoid partial verification.",Coronary angiography.,Coronary artery stenosis was defined as at least 50% narrowing in at least one epicardial coronary artery on coronary angiography. We defined severe coronary artery stenosis as ≥ 70% stenosis on coronary angiography.,"Study participants included all patients who were considered to be potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney-pancreas transplantation at the time the diagnostic tests were performed.  Inclusion criteria We included studies reporting outcomes relating to patients considered to be potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney-pancreas transplantation at the time diagnostic tests were performed. To ensure that our review was accessible and succinct, we chose to limit the population to patients with CKD who were considered candidates for kidney transplantation, but included all possible tests used to diagnose CAD. Exclusion criteria Studies were excluded if they did not explicitly state that all study participants were candidates for kidney transplantation. We also excluded studies that investigated cardiac test accuracy in patients with ESKD who were not transplant candidates (i.e. they were unselected dialysis patients, not undergoing pre-transplant assessment). Patients with ESKD who are not transplantation candidates differ from patients who are transplant candidates with respect to several key prognostic variables, such as age and fitness for surgery. These differences in the key prognostic variables may result in differences in disease prevalence and test performance. We also excluded studies which investigated patients with features of acute coronary syndrome as our aim was to investigate the performance of cardiac tests in a preoperative screening context.

CD008759,"Platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in people with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices of any size in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of their aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of these non-invasive tests as triage or replacement of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. We considered separately studies with adult participants and studies with paediatric participants.","Platelet count is obtained from a complete blood count, a readily available automated clinical test. A platelet count cut-off value less than 150,000/mm3 is considered thrombocytopenia. Spleen length is usually obtained through evaluation of the patient's abdomen by ultrasound scan (USS). Interobserver agreement when spleen length is determined with USS is considered excellent. For adults, the upper limit of spleen length is 130 mm, beyond which the spleen is generally considered enlarged. Spleen length of 110 mm is regarded as a sensitive cut-off for exclusion of splenomegaly (Grover 1993). For children, spleen length is expressed as a standard deviation score relative to normal values for both age and sex (spleen length z-score) (Megremis 2004). Platelet count-to-spleen length ratio is a derivative mathematical model shown to increase the accuracy of both non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices. The cut-off value used most often for adults is 909 (n/mm3)/mm. In children, platelet count-to-spleen length ratio is calculated using the spleen length z-score.","Primary objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices of any size in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of their aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of these non-invasive tests as triage or replacement of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. We considered separately studies with adult participants and studies with paediatric participants. Secondary objectives To compare the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of high-risk oesophageal varices in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. We aimed to perform pair-wise comparisons between the three index tests, while considering predefined cut-off values, as reported in the 'Index test' section. We investigated the following sources of heterogeneity. Chronic liver disease compared with portal vein thrombosis. Prevalence of oesophageal varices in the study group (≥ 50% versus < 50% for any varices; > 25% versus ≤ 25% for high-risk varices). Severity of liver disease Child A (> 50% versus ≤ 50%). Different aetiologies (hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated cirrhosis versus cirrhosis of all causes).","Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy is the clinical reference standard test for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in which the presence of varices in the oesophagus is directly observed through the endoscope. The size and appearance of oesophageal varices are graded at the time of endoscopy according to one of the systems described below, and the largest varix identified is used to classify the patient. Severity of cirrhosis, which is the other factor that defines bleeding risk, is assessed by Child-Pugh score, with three classes - A, B, and C - indicating increasing severity (Pugh 1973). Patients whose largest varix is medium or large or who are included in class B-C are considered for prophylactic therapy. The Baveno Consensus system differentiates small from large oesophageal varices (de Franchis 1992), defining small oesophageal varices as varices that flatten with insufflation during endoscopy or that minimally protrude into the oesophageal lumen, and large oesophageal varices as varices that protrude into the oesophageal lumen and touch each other, or that fill at least 50% of the oesophageal lumen. The Japanese Research Society for Portal Hypertension used three grades for variceal size (JSPH 1980). Grade 1 varices collapse with insufflation during endoscopy, grade 2 varices do not collapse with insufflation and do not occlude the lumen, and grade 3 varices occlude the lumen. For this review, we will consider grade 2 as equivalent to medium, and grade 3 as large. The Japanese classification was revised by the Italian Liver Cirrhosis Project (ILCP) Group (Pagliaro 1988; Zoli 1996), which describes variceal size as the percentage of the radius of the oesophageal lumen that is occupied by the largest varix. A small or grade 1 varix is said to occupy less than 25%, a medium or grade 2 varix occupies 25% to 50%, and a large or grade 3 varix occupies greater than 50% of the radius of the lumen of the oesophagus. The Cales criteria define varices as small if they flatten with insufflation during endoscopy, medium if they do not flatten with insufflation, and large if they do not flatten with insufflation during endoscopy and are confluent (Cales 1990). We will include studies applying alternate classifications if adequately described and logically defined. Red marks are usually noted as present or absent and may be described according to different classifications. Even small varices showing red marks are classified as ’at high risk of bleeding’.  The interval between index tests and oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy has to be less than 3 months to avoid possible evolution of the target condition. When a study reported longer time intervals, we included the study but considered it to be at risk of bias. Clinically, patients with medium or large oesophageal varices or with red marks are at greatest risk of haemorrhage; therefore, we confined secondary analyses to two subgroups: patients with no varices and small varices compared with patients at high risk.","The presence of any oesophageal varices (independent of size) was detected by oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. For secondary analyses, the target condition considered was the presence of oesophageal varices at high risk of bleeding. High-risk varices were defined as medium or large varices or small varices with red marks, or in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, as assessed by a B-C Child-Pugh score (Garcia-Tsao 2007). Studies will require at least one of two target conditions to be identified: the presence of any oesophageal varices, or the presence of high-risk varices.","Participants included paediatric or adult patients of any age with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology, severity of disease, and duration of illness, in whom the presence or absence of varices was confirmed by oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. The review focused on diagnostic questions related to patients who have not yet suffered gastrointestinal bleeding from oesophageal varices. Patients with a previous surgical portal-systemic shunt procedure or insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS), previous ligation or sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices, previous history of upper gastrointestinal portal hypertensive bleeding, or previous primary prophylactic therapy of variceal haemorrhage make up a distinct group for whom the diagnosis or natural history of oesophageal varices has been modified. These patients were not the focus of this review, hence we excluded studies that included such patients unless investigators presented data in such a way as to allow this patient group to be isolated from other included patients.","We aimed to include studies that, irrespective of publication status and language, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices with oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy as the reference standard. We considered studies of cross-sectional cohort design including people with clinical suspicion of portal hypertension as well as studies of participant-control design that compared people with oesophageal varices versus matched controls (Colli 2014a). We excluded studies that analysed data only per varix rather than per participant unless participant data were made available by study authors.","[23599624, 20009131, 25826654, 17544879, 26939226, 22888334, 7828573, 21196656, 10482429, 26285468, 26212020, 19669263, 21925123, 26751694, 18594972, 12870732, 17047433, 18925306, 17029607, 12865282, 19196464, 11743252, 18161700, 23383250, 26912006, 17914969, 20615567, 21912056, 19292923, 14987868, 21544150, 2086047, 18562980, 22788929, 13280279, 25199304, 19200133, 16110174, 21175810, 11718587, 21140089, 22915236, 26197990, 20044810, 24224779, 10566732, 21596631, 10566731, 1520164, 26588019, 16542615, 20065573, 22643348, 15996912, 19966576, 19065558, 23022955, 27281094, 22087154, 17140886, 19593164, 26196942, 18416480, 20190717, 24616574, 23629600, 19013661, 15194662, 22385886, 1664752, 10580584, 18223377, 21691209, 14752839, 17577118]","[23599624, 17544879, 22888334, 21196656, 26285468, 26212020, 21925123, 26751694, 18594972, 17047433, 18925306, 17029607, 12865282, 11743252, 20615567, 21912056, 19292923, 14987868, 21544150, 2086047, 18562980, 22788929, 13280279, 25199304, 16110174, 21175810, 11718587, 21140089, 22915236, 21596631, 1520164, 20065573, 22643348, 15996912, 19065558, 23022955, 27281094, 22087154, 17140886, 19593164, 18416480, 20190717, 24616574, 23629600, 19013661, 15194662, 22385886, 1664752, 10580584, 21691209, 14752839, 17577118]"
CD008760,Capsule endoscopy for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in people with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in children or adults with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of the aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of capsule endoscopy as triage or replacement of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy.","Capsule endoscopy The video capsule endoscope is a wireless capsule comprised of a light source, lens, imaging hardware, battery, and a wireless transmitter, designed to investigate the oesophagus. The capsule is swallowed; it moves down the oesophagus via peristalsis. To improve the oesophagus visualisation, the device can be modified by attaching a string to control movement up and down the oesophagus (string capsule). The capsule obtains photographs at high frequency that are transmitted to a recorder, worn on a belt. The photographs are downloaded into a computer and can be viewed individually or as a video. There is a variety of classifications reported for oesophageal varices observed with capsule endoscopy, with no current consensus. The reported methods for evaluating the size of the oesophageal varices with capsule endoscopy are frequently identical to oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy in spite of the lack of air inflation (which is not possible with the capsule endoscopy). To standardise the classification for the purposes of this review, oesophageal varices observed with capsule endoscopy were dichotomised in the following way: absence or presence of varices; and, small compared to medium or large varices. A small varix is said to occupy less than 25% and a medium/large varix to occupy more than 25% of the radius of the lumen of the oesophagus. The description of red marks on the varices follows the criteria used for oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy: raised cherry-red spots (dilated sub-epithelial veins) and red wale marking (longitudinal dilated veins resembling whip marks).","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in children or adults with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of the aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of capsule endoscopy as triage or replacement of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Secondary objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy for the diagnosis of medium oesophageal varices, large oesophageal varices, and presence of red marks on the varices. The following study characteristics, oesophageal varices, paediatric compared to adult participants, chronic liver disease compared to portal vein thrombosis, different stages of liver disease severity, different aetiologies of liver disease (e.g., viral cirrhosis compared with alcoholic cirrhosis; cholestatic compared to non-cholestatic liver disease), prevalence of oesophageal varices in the study group, and co-morbidities, were considered as sources of heterogeneity.","Oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy is the reference standard test for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in which the presence of varices in the oesophagus is directly observed by endoscopy. The size and appearance of oesophageal varices is graded at the time of endoscopy according to one of the following systems, using the largest varix identified to classify the participant. People with an indication for primary prophylactic therapy are considered to be those whose largest varix is medium or large in size, or with small varices with red marks.  The Baveno Consensus system differentiates small from large oesophageal varices (de Franchis 1992). Small varices are defined as varices that flatten with insufflation during endoscopy or that minimally protrude into the oesophageal lumen. Large oesophageal varices are defined as varices that protrude into the oesophageal lumen and touch each other, or that fill at least 50% of the oesophageal lumen.  The Japanese Research Society for Portal Hypertension used three grades for variceal size (JSPH 1980). Grade 1 varices collapse with insufflation during endoscopy, grade 2 do not collapse with insufflation and do not occlude the lumen, and grade 3 varices occlude the lumen. Grade 2 varices were considered equivalent to medium, and grade 3 varices equivalent to large for this review.  The Japanese classification was revised by the Italian Liver Cirrhosis Project Group (Zoli 1996), which describes variceal size as the percentage of the radius of the oesophageal lumen that is occupied by the largest varix. A small or grade 1 varix is said to occupy less than 25%, a medium or grade 2 varix to occupy 25% to 50%, and a large or grade 3 varix to occupy greater than 50% of the radius of the lumen of the oesophagus.  The Cales criteria define varices as small if they flatten with insufflation during endoscopy, medium if they do not flatten with insufflation, and large if they do not flatten with insufflation during endoscopy and are confluent (Cales 1990).  We included studies applying other classifications if adequately described and logically defined.  The presence of red marks is usually noted as present or absent and may also be described according to different classifications. Even small varices with the presence of red marks are classified as 'at high risk of bleeding'.  The interval between the index test and oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy has to be less than 14 days in order to avoid possible evolution of the target condition. In the case of longer time intervals, we included the study but considered it at risk of bias.","Target conditions The presence of any oesophageal varices (independent of size), detected by oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. For secondary analyses, the presence of medium or large varices (Garcia-Tsao 2007), and the presence of red marks were considered the target conditions.","could be of any age in whom the presence of oesophageal varices was clinically suspected (screening cohort) based on chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of the aetiology and duration of illness. We also considered people with previous history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or already diagnosed oesophageal varices (surveillance cohort) for our review as these participants are a distinct group in whom the presence of oesophageal varices has a very higher probability than in a screening cohort, and when they participated in the studies, we analysed their data separately. We excluded studies with people with a previous surgical portal-systemic shunt procedure or insertion of transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt, previous ligation, or sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices.","We aimed to include studies that, irrespective of publication status and language, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices using oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy as the reference standard.

There are currently no generally accepted standards for the plasma or CSF Aß test threshold, and therefore it was not possible to pre-specify what constituted a positive or negative result. The thresholds that we used in this review were those generated and presented within each included study. It should be noted that where Aß42 and Aß40 data were presented separately, rather than as a ratio, then both tests would be analysed separately. Measure of index test: Aß level in plasma or CSF, or both (ng.l-1 or pg.ml-1). The assays most commonly used are conventional Innogenetics INNOTEST beta-amyloid1-42 kit or the multiplexing INNO-BIA AlzBio3 for CSF, or INNO-BIA plasma Aß forms for plasma. We did not include a comparator test because there are currently no standard practice tests available for the diagnosis of dementia.","To determine the accuracy of plasma and CSF Aß levels in identifying those participants with MCI at baseline who will convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over time. Secondary objectives To determine the nature, extent and impact of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and CSF Aß levels.","The gold standard for Alzheimer's disease dementia is a post-mortem. There is no ‘gold-standard’ ante-mortem diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease dementia. Therefore, the reference standard in this review was conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia based on the National Institute for National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria (McKhann 1984) to define ‘probable’ Alzheimer's disease. The NINCDS-ADRDA criteria define three ante-mortem groups: probable, possible and unlikely Alzheimer's disease dementia, based on evaluation of eight cognitive domains including memory and language. The post-consensus (on those cases in which there is a disagreement) specificity of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria is 0.84 and its sensitivity is 0.83 (Blacker 1994) against post-mortem diagnosis. Exploring the impact of using different post-mortem definitions of Alzheimer's disease, Nagy 1998 showed that the sensitivity of ‘possible’ and ‘probable’ dementia of the Alzheimer’s type according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria is 91% to 98% compared to the post-mortem Khachaturian criteria, Tierney A3 criteria and the CERAD protocol at autopsy. Studies using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria (DSM) (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) criteria (World Health Organization 2010) exclusively to diagnose Alzheimer's disease dementia were also considered though the criteria would be entered as a covariate to assess their impact on results. For Lewy body dementia as an outcome the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996); for frontotemporal dementia, the Lund Criteria (Lund 1994); and for vascular dementia the NINDS AIREN criteria (Roman 1993).",There were two target conditions in this review: Alzheimer’s disease dementia (conversion from cognitive decline no dementia to Alzheimer’s disease dementia); any other forms of dementia (conversion from cognitive decline no dementia to other (non-Alzheimer's) forms of dementia); any dementia (conversion from cognitive decline no dementia to any form of dementia).,"We included participants who were diagnosed with a cognitive decline but with no dementia condition at baseline. The cognitive decline but no dementia group is defined as patients who have been diagnosed using any of the Petersen criteria, or Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5, or any of the 16 definitions included by Matthews (Matthews 2008). We excluded those patients or populations with cognitive decline no dementia possibly caused by: current or a history of alcohol or drug abuse; central nervous system (CNS) trauma (e.g. subdural haematoma), tumour or infection; other neurological conditions e.g. Parkinson’s or Huntingdon’s diseases; any other dementia co-morbidity e.g. frontotemporal or vascular dementias. We excluded studies that included patients with psychiatric, neurological, metabolic, immunological, hormonal or cerebrovascular disorders, or patients likely to have a genetic cause for their dementia (for example familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, or Huntington’s disease). If participants were involved in disease modifying clinical trials we excluded them from the analysis. Patients with a family history of Alzheimer's disease dementia may be more readily diagnosed with MCI and therefore there can be spectrum bias with these participants. On this basis we examined separately those studies which included those with a known genetic predisposition. Similarly, early onset Alzheimer's disease dementia, defined as a diagnosis under the age of 50 years, is likely to indicate a different aetiopathogenesis from late onset Alzheimer's disease dementia (including autosomally inherited mutation in the presenilin 1 and 2 genes, or the amyloid precursor protein (Filley 2007)). We excluded studies which included patients below the age of 50 years. With regard to duration of follow-up, Bruscoli 2004 indicated that an annual average of 10% of MCI patients become demented and therefore cohort studies would ideally have a minimum follow-up time of 24 months. This provides a conversion rate to Alzheimer's disease dementia of approximately 19% and gives sufficient time for clinicians to diagnose a cause of MCI. Shorter durations of follow-up may yield low conversion rates.","We included all studies that had prospectively well defined cohorts with any accepted definition of cognitive decline but no dementia with baseline CSF or plasma Aß levels, or both, documented at or around the time that the above diagnoses were made. We also included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and contained sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 tables expressing plasma and CSF Aß biomarker results by disease status. The results in those that progressed to clinical Alzheimer's dementia were compared to those who did not progress, improved or developed another dementia. We excluded any studies which potentially overlapped patient data and recorded them as multiple publications. We also excluded review papers.","[21297262, 17124416, 19584444, 20625095, 18525127, 18486992, 16488378, 12433260, 18535375, 22302554, 19622817, 20625167, 14615052, 17374949, 19864909, 19939224, 21220682, 19296504, 22475796, 20478847, 21460434, 21399907, 14699432, 22213792, 20697045, 16274728, 21898322, 19236926, 21700579, 20935035, 21159408, 19628938, 16546302, 20632026, 21670386, 21440911, 19965857, 19684400, 19748159, 21998317, 22057225, 18401021, 15824371, 20930282, 19420940]","[18525127, 16488378, 18535375, 22302554, 19622817, 20625167, 14615052, 17374949, 19864909, 19939224, 21220682, 19296504, 22475796, 21460434, 21399907, 14699432, 22213792, 20697045, 16274728, 19236926, 20935035, 21159408, 19628938, 16546302, 20632026, 21670386, 21440911, 19684400, 19748159, 21998317, 22057225, 15824371, 20930282, 19420940]"
CD008803,Optic nerve head and fibre layer imaging for diagnosing glaucoma,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of HRT, OCT and GDx for diagnosing manifest glaucoma by detecting ONH and RNFL damage.","We assessed the following imaging devices: confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT); optical coherence tomography (OCT); and scanning laser polarimetry (GDx). For each test we extracted and analysed all parameters which can be obtained with standard commercial software and are measuring RNFL or ONH morphology. During the review process, we decided to extract OCT measures that are not related to RNFL and ONH morphology, but to macular cell layers affected by glaucoma, such as ganglion cell complex (GCC) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), as these parameters have gained popularity in recent years.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of HRT, OCT and GDx for diagnosing manifest glaucoma by detecting ONH and RNFL damage. Secondary objectives To determine which morphometric measure or diagnostic algorithm yields the highest diagnostic accuracy within each device. To compare the relative diagnostic accuracy of the three devices. To explore potential causes of heterogeneity of diagnostic performance across studies. We planned to investigate the following sources of clinical heterogeneity: A. Heterogeneity related to the choice of reference standard: type of reference standard (optic disc assessment, visual field, or both); definitions of visual field damage. B. Heterogeneity related to characteristics of the study population: severity of glaucoma. C. Heterogeneity related to issues of methodological quality. As we expected a large number of included studies to be case-control, we considered a particular type of bias resembling incorporation bias for these studies. Usually the investigator assessing the presence of glaucoma does not rely exclusively on valid perimetric criteria to allocate patients to the glaucoma group, but also on optic disc appearance such as cupping. Diseased patients may have larger cups than expected, thus enhancing the ability of imaging methods to detect disease based on disc morphology algorithms. For this reason, we investigated heterogeneity between case-control studies using visual field only versus case-control studies using visual field plus optic disc as a reference standard. We considered visual field alone the preferred, unbiased reference standard method (Garway-Heath 1998). We originally planned to investigate heterogeneity based on specific methodological issues of included studies (Appendix 1): inclusion of a representative spectrum of patients; reporting of uninterpretable results; choice of unit of analysis. However, we then adopted QUADAS 2 and used its domains for heterogeneity investigation. Finally, we planned an exploratory subgroup analysis based on the overall level of missing data, regardless of their cause (including withdrawals and any patients who may have been excluded because of uninterpretable index test results), using the median level of missing data across studies to define better versus worse quality, as well as a level of 10% missing data for the same purpose. We planned further subgroup analyses to investigate the contribution of studies that did not report any missing data but did not explicitly state that there were no missing data.","There is no universally-accepted reference standard for the diagnosis of manifest glaucoma. Both optic disc and visual field damage are used to diagnose the presence of glaucoma. Several systems have been proposed to score visual field and optic disc damage and have been tested in multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (AGIS 1994; CIGTS 1999; EMGT 1999). While we accepted any diagnosis of glaucoma given by the study investigators, we conducted subgroup analyses to assess whether differences between studies could be explained by the choice of the reference standard.",The target condition of interest was manifest glaucoma.,"The tests on which this review focuses have not been extensively studied in population-based screening studies, which should be the subject of a future Cochrane review on screening tests for glaucoma. The published protocol for this review stated we would include glaucoma suspects, but did not fully specify the professional and clinical pathway stage at which such a question is made. Framing the question in a well-defined pathay is also difficult due to variation of eye care pattens in different health care settings. In retrospect, the findings of this review could be used in an add-on setting which could be a primary care, or a triage setting when somebody has already been referred from primary care to secondary care as suspect glaucoma and needs triage by a non glaucoma specialist","We planned to include all prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies that evaluate the accuracy of OCT, HRT or the GDx for diagnosing glaucoma. We included both single studies assessing each imaging method and comparative studies assessing more than one imaging method in the same patient population. We included only studies that provide data to allow calculation of sensitivity and specificity estimates. A first draft of this review was submitted based on a literature search conducted until 15 June 2013, which identified a large number of case-control studies. During the revision of the final version of this review, we updated the search to 15 February 2015 and found some additional case-control studies. We decided not to include these additional case-control studies, as they are known to be prone to methodological biases and unlikely to change the current evidence base. Future updates of this review should only focus on studies where the patient population is enrolled consecutively, with the same set of inclusion criteria, such as referable patients identified in primary care.

Bone marrow culture. Peripheral blood culture, peripheral blood PCR, or both. We defined a Grade 1 study as one that used both bone marrow culture and peripheral blood culture as the reference standard.

When radiolabeled DMSA is given to patients whose tubular cell function is impaired because of pyelonephritis, the scan will show a photon-deficient area(s). This test is conducted by trained nuclear medicine physicians in a hospital's radiology department. For the purpose of this analysis, any photopenia (with or without a loss of contours) was considered as pyelonephritis. Only studies in which a planar DMSA scan was performed within the first month of the diagnosis of UTI were included. Because the accuracy of the DMSA scan decreases significantly if obtained later than two weeks after the diagnosis of UTI (Stokland 1996), we conducted sensitivity analysis with respect to timing of the DMSA scan. Because single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) DMSA scans have much lower specificity (66%, Craig 2000), studies in which SPECT DMSA scans were used were not included in this review.",Acute pyelonephritis as evidenced by photopenia (with or without a change in contours) on an acute-phase DMSA scan was the target condition of interest.,"Studies including children from birth to 18 years of age with a culture-confirmed episode of UTI were eligible for inclusion.

Studies that did not meet these minimum, and rather permissive criteria, were excluded. Because specimens obtained using a perineal bag are often falsely positive, the effect of including studies in which some of the urine specimens were collected using a bag was explored.

This was performed within and between (objective 1.1 compared to objective 2.1) included studies. ¹²³I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy was the comparator test in this case.,"The optimal combination of reference tests is described below. However, we did not exclude studies that did not use the optimal combination of reference tests.  The reference tests for the diagnosis of the primary neuroblastoma tumour were as follows:  An unequivocal pathological diagnosis according to the Shimada classification or the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) (Brodeur 1984; Joshi 2000; Peuchmaur 2003; Shimada 1984; Shimada 1993; Shimada 1999a; Shimada 1999b; Shimada 2003). Tumour tissue was examined by use of light or electron microscopy with immunohistochemistry. At least two of the following antigens had to be positive: neuron-specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin or chromogranin A (CGA). Tissue had to be preferably obtained by the use of Trucut, core-needle biopsy. However, if this approach was contra-indicated, fine-needle aspiration could be used (Brodeur 1993).  A bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy containing unequivocal tumour cells. These are immunocytologically positive clumps of cells, containing antibodies against at least two of the following antigens: NSE, synaptophysin or CGA (Brodeur 1993).  Histopathology during or after treatment (e.g. tissue obtained during surgery), if excretion of catecholamines in the urine was elevated at diagnosis and additional imaging modalities (e.g. ultrasound, CT scan, MRI scan) suggested a neuroblastoma at diagnosis.  Three different tests were used as possible reference standards. If only one of the three reference standards had a positive result, the diagnosis neuroblastoma could be confirmed. However, to reject the diagnosis neuroblastoma all three had to give a negative result.  The reference tests for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma metastases (separately from the primary tumour) were as follows:  Bone marrow metastases: To determine bone marrow invasion, at least two different puncture sites were mandatory (although four puncture sites should always be aimed for). Representative smears (five smears from each puncture site) and EDTA/heparin bone marrow (3 to 5 mL from each puncture site) had to be sampled for PCR or immunocytology, or both. Only if no fluid bone marrow in sufficient quality or quantity could be aspirated, trephine biopsies from this puncture site are recommended (Beiske 2009).  Bone metastases: Positive lesions on a 99m-Tc skeleton scintigraphy, MRI, CT scan, or a combination of these tests.  Lymph node metastases: Histologically proven palpable nodes or ultrasound, MRI or CT scan for non-palpable nodes, or both.  Liver metastases: Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan or a combination of these tests.  Diagnosis of neuroblastoma metastases resulted from at least one positive result of these reference tests. The result for the metastases was assumed negative if all reference tests were negative.  There are no inadequate reference standards in the diagnostic process of neuroblastoma. Histopathology is the gold standard, but it is not always possible to perform. Therefore other reference tests, when combined, are also needed in the diagnosis of neuroblastoma.",Target conditions Neuroblastoma at first diagnosis or at recurrence.,"Children from 0 to 18 years old with suspected neuroblastoma and its metastases of any stage at first diagnosis or at recurrence in a tertiary care centre of paediatric oncology. We excluded studies on animals, studies not performed in children with suspected neuroblastoma, studies performed in children with esthesioneuroblastoma and olfactory neuroblastoma, and studies on the therapeutic use of MIBG.","We included primary diagnostic studies if they compared the results of ¹²³I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy, 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) imaging, or both, with the tests described as reference standards (as defined below) and if they compared the results of both tests with each other. Studies needed to be of a cross-sectional design or a case series of proven neuroblastoma. Patient selection could be either retrospective or prospective. We excluded case reports, studies that described fewer than ten patients suspected for neuroblastoma and diagnostic case-control studies. Studies had to report sufficient data to construct (part of) a two-by-two table, i.e. at least the absolute number of true positives and false negatives had to be available from the data reported in the primary studies or obtainable from the study authors to calculate the sensitivity and if possible the specificity. ¹²³I-MIBG scintigraphy is only performed when there is a high suspicion of a neuroblastoma based on clinical information, excretion of catecholamines in the urine and different imaging methods. Therefore, it is expected that mainly the outcome of MIBG scans in patients with finally proven neuroblastoma will be reported and that thus often only sensitivity can be analysed.","[18397155, 2537501, 12931322, 19440765, 17921023, 16826853, 21052659, 18356459, 9293786, 8495568, 20080883, 16580935, 3330445, 8489488, 4012198, 19040932, 14734903, 16601361, 15886751, 17343665, 7978868, 12833468, 18636251, 21279352, 10918246, 21119255, 16759621, 11464889, 1869992, 15693653, 8176462, 17455877, 21131746, 19617326, 1782063, 3055307, 3597111, 18632825, 27841143, 2068163, 8637999, 2160683, 18339348, 11496360, 1491958, 16544298, 12089489, 11454888, 2300771, 18942414, 22237841, 16314956, 8321790, 1437370, 2919085, 17015899, 9172551, 19724988, 19884537, 3021678, 9634471, 8336186, 21172969, 10656556, 10587139, 19440769, 7786916, 18324597, 19877910, 19440764, 2846227, 2546031, 21383641, 9486080, 8028223, 18470455, 18043535, 10029806, 8790194, 21157198, 10029803, 12415343, 3585505, 10742058, 19434281, 7640762, 11813196, 21617976, 2236834, 21460401, 8635381, 2313350, 8259095, 2313352, 9002745, 21328522, 1651031, 16444675, 20113676, 11202443, 9266191, 14500242, 11878578, 1817838, 21362518, 11748431, 12773693, 3665302, 3770009, 20080890, 9179199, 2893906, 8414753, 12647978, 2178460, 8217371, 18750402, 2023691, 20591596, 14971604, 19171702, 8475610, 12829667, 11568913, 7837704, 3904127, 8315483, 17074666, 22555324, 2093889, 2380153, 11448079, 20432004, 12173016, 3359060, 12571457, 21680684, 8287875, 20923718, 21932116, 18709509, 3326506, 22528971, 20103666, 12960186, 2147757, 14762700, 12594725, 19171710, 2710644, 8350359, 18719909, 27156819, 15381463, 2351179, 26195703, 3967603, 23121084, 19922836, 1522257, 16950144, 10485244, 17657930, 21685821, 2062676, 9486081, 7824731, 8692485, 18053828, 21803181, 9673731]","[99999999, 19617326, 18942414, 2313350, 8259095, 21328522, 14500242, 14971604, 21932116, 3326506, 10485244]"
CD009323,Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer,To determine the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic laparoscopy performed as an add-on test to CT scanning in the assessment of curative resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer.,We included only diagnostic laparoscopy in which histopathological confirmation of metastatic spread was obtained on a paraffin section.,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic laparoscopy performed as an add-on test to CT scanning in the assessment of curative resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Secondary objectives We planned to explore the following sources of heterogeneity. Studies at low risk of bias versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool, recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group) (Whiting 2006; Whiting 2011). Full text publications versus abstracts (this can give a clue about publication bias since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication status (Eloubeidi 2001). Prospective studies versus retrospective studies. Proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer, ampullary cancer, and bile duct cancers (although classified as periampullary cancers they each have a different prognosis) (Klempnauer 1995). The additional value of diagnostic laparoscopy may be different because of the extent of spread in these different types of periampullary cancers. Procedures performed under the same anaesthetic versus procedures performed under a different anaesthetic (there are likely to be differences in the histopathological examinations since the former procedure is associated with frozen section biopsy while the latter procedure is likely to be associated with paraffin section). Paraffin section is considered the gold standard in identifying cancer. Frozen sections can be associated with false negative results (Yeo 2002). However, frozen section results are always confirmed by paraffin section histological examinations. Different definitions for resectable cancer on laparotomy. Different surgeons may consider cancer unresectable differently i.e. different surgeons will have different criteria for unresectability on laparotomy (other than the consensus criteria for resectability). For example, one surgeon may judge that the cancer is unresectable on laparotomy because of the involvement of the vessel and consider the reference standard to be positive. This will result in a false negative result for laparoscopy. Another surgeon may judge the same cancer to be resectable despite the involvement of the vessel and proceed with resection. The reference standard will be negative in this situation resulting in a true negative result for laparoscopy. This might have an intrinsic threshold effect. Additional pre-tests performed (besides CT scan). This can alter the pre-test probability of unresectability and can help in the assessment of the additional value of diagnostic laparoscopy under various situations.","Confirmation of liver or peritoneal involvement by histopathological examination of suspicious (liver or peritoneal) lesions obtained at diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy. We accepted only paraffin section histology as the reference standard. In clinical practice, depending on the urgency of the results, a frozen section biopsy may be done to obtain immediate results. However, this is always confirmed by subsequent paraffin section histology (which can take several days) because frozen section biopsy is not as reliable as paraffin section histology. We also accepted the surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy when biopsy confirmation was not possible. For example, if the tumour has invaded the adjacent blood vessels the surgeon may not resect the tumour because of the danger posed by resecting part of a large blood vessel, and so biopsy confirmation cannot be obtained. Diagnostic laparoscopy results versus reference standard results A schematic diagram of the results of diagnostic laparoscopy against those of histopathology or laparotomy is shown in Figure 2. Positive histopathology of a biopsy taken during diagnostic laparoscopy confirms the presence of cancer (true positive). Thus, the index test and the reference standard are one and the same if there is positive histopathology after laparoscopy. As a result, false positives are not possible and there is no sampling error associated with specificity because it is by definition equal to 1. If the histopathology is negative, the surgeon will perform a laparotomy. The cancer may be resectable with curative intent (true negative) or may not be resectable with curative intent (false negative) based on histopathological confirmation or the surgeon's judgement of unresectability on laparotomy if biopsy confirmation cannot be obtained.

In these cancers it is not possible to perform curative resectability. There are no uniform criteria for resectability of pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Consensus exists for the definition of borderline resectable cancers (Abrams 2009). Therefore, where there is less tissue involvement than in a borderline resectable cancer the tumour can be considered as resectable. We accepted any criteria of resectability used by the study authors and acknowledge that this could potentially create a threshold effect. In general, the cancer would not be resected if liver or peritoneal metastases were noted, or if the cancer had invaded important adjacent blood vessels that are beyond the criteria for borderline resectable cancers, for example, greater than 180 ° involvement of the superior mesenteric artery.","Patients about to undergo curative resection for pancreatic and periampullary cancer and found to have no contraindications (such as metastatic disease) for curative resection on CT scan, and who are anaesthetically fit to undergo major surgery.","We included studies that evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic laparoscopy in the appropriate patient population (see below) irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

For proteinuria, results are scored as 0 (negative), trace-positive (tr), 1+ (30 mg protein/dL), 2++ (100 mg protein/dL), or 3+++ (500 mg protein/dL) (Murare 1987). Antigen tests Antigen tests are based on detection of schistosome antigens in the serum and urine of individuals (Gryseels 2006; WHO/TDR 2006; Gryseels 2012).

We therefore included studies that use all of these concentration techniques, and to estimate the effect of the quality of the reference standard, we accepted studies using microscopy on a single urine sample (lower‐quality reference standard) and studies performing microscopy on multiple urine samples (higher‐quality reference standard).  S. mansoni  For diagnosis of S. mansoni infection, microscopic examination of schistosome eggs in stool is the reference standard. Sensitivity is increased by preparing a faecal thick smear using the Kato‐Katz (KK) method (Gryseels 2006) or by examining multiple stool samples (Feldmeier 1993). To estimate the effect of the quality of the reference standard, we accepted studies using microscopy on a single stool sample (lower‐quality reference standard) and studies performing microscopy on multiple stool samples (higher‐quality reference standard).  It is important to note that some regions experience mixed infections of S. haematobium and S. mansoni. In such situations, microscopy of both stool and urine samples must be carried out to confirm infection.",Active infection with S. haematobium. Active infection with S. mansoni.,"had to be individuals residing in regions where S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections were endemic. We excluded articles that studied travelers originating from non-endemic countries, as they were typically screened with other tests such as antibody tests.","We included primary observational studies that compared the results of one or more of the index tests versus the reference standard. These studies could be cross-sectional in design, cohort studies, or diagnostic case-control studies with cases and controls sampled from the same patient population. We included studies that provide participant data. Only studies in which true-positives (TPs), true-negatives (TNs), false-positives (FPs), and false-negatives (FNs) were reported or could be extracted from the data were included. We excluded case-control studies with healthy controls, controls from non-endemic areas, or controls with alternative diagnoses (patients with diseases similar to schistosomiasis), as specificity may be overestimated (Rutjes 2005). False-positive test results may occur when an alternative disease produces the same pathophysiological changes as the target condition. We also excluded studies that enrolled only participants with proven schistosomiasis, as sensitivity may be overestimated.","[6842031, 1674405, 11280068, 7780448, 22118038, 24742192, 7112663, 7594673, 3133320, 1621898, 1621899, 3872732, 21540390, 1452992, 3099659, 9277012, 7844425, 8790772, 19426665, 18642508, 11551310, 7814474, 1969705, 23590255, 3149173, 7796771, 9840595, 9840597, 17368699, 18784236, 9196755, 2510528, 2859753, 10403328, 1980801, 15361112, 8698022, 24727052, 2505381, 7677216, 3142286, 7821252, 23469295, 9684644, 2492777, 3098475, 17298129, 23202602, 10882905, 2515625, 9692172, 442186, 7785523, 18951599, 9270735, 21245910, 22860148, 1443344, 1758012, 9196777, 2128984, 10672206, 10326107, 1564319, 23556011, 18416249, 24593687, 10326120, 19547872, 7210818, 9028412, 6486295, 2475060, 9492912, 23339198, 24952121, 6138974, 6138972, 3934451, 10674091, 10548300, 9231197, 8203296, 8026352, 19068147, 484768, 15477190, 3872731, 1440818, 8096108, 6133057, 3151529, 10813502, 10813503, 10813501, 10813504, 9311651, 9749635, 11155931, 7154900, 24743389, 2545370, 3116682, 8619439, 3140683, 7872453, 23359826, 23716406, 15583265, 12002103, 19168393, 19818057, 22132246, 7570876, 8985756, 18817603, 10029916, 7570817, 10885183, 16386231, 11784423, 1571210, 21354093, 7458464, 15104153, 23236526, 19270295, 16153313, 8011824, 10463669, 3151417, 2121056, 7810384, 3087728, 1354933, 21692957, 8644912, 8757703]","[11280068, 7780448, 22118038, 3133320, 3872732, 1452992, 3099659, 19426665, 18642508, 11551310, 23590255, 3149173, 7796771, 17368699, 2859753, 10403328, 15361112, 8698022, 24727052, 7677216, 3142286, 10882905, 9692172, 442186, 7785523, 18951599, 22860148, 1758012, 10672206, 10326107, 23556011, 18416249, 24593687, 19547872, 9028412, 6486295, 2475060, 9492912, 23339198, 24952121, 6138974, 6138972, 10674091, 8026352, 19068147, 484768, 1440818, 8096108, 10813502, 10813503, 10813501, 10813504, 9311651, 9749635, 7154900, 2545370, 3116682, 8619439, 3140683, 7872453, 12002103, 19168393, 19818057, 22132246, 7570876, 8985756, 7570817, 10885183, 16386231, 11784423, 7458464, 15104153, 16153313, 2121056, 3087728, 1354933, 21692957, 8644912, 8757703]"
CD009591,Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis,"To provide the estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.","All types of imaging modalities for endometriosis, including possible modifications to conventional techniques, were assessed separately or in combination with other imaging tests. We attempted to group several types of tests that were based on common technical principles and similarity in clinical applicability. The index tests assessed are presented and described in Table 2. We considered studies only if data were reported in sufficient detail for construction of 2 × 2 contingency tables. We included only studies that reported diagnostic accuracy estimates per number of participants ('participant-level' analysis). We undertook an independent evaluation of the diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests to anatomically map endometriotic lesions because multiple endometriotic implants can co-exist at different sites in the same individual. For this 'region level' analysis, only analyses that recorded data estimates per number of participants were included, as information about the accuracy of imaging tests for mapping the disease is more informative and clinically applicable when presented as per-participant calculations of accuracy estimates. Combined evaluations of imaging tests and other methods of diagnosing endometriosis (e.g. pelvic examination; urine, endometrial or blood tests) are beyond the scope of this review and are presented separately in another review titled 'Combined tests for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis'. We excluded from the review studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, radiological criteria or interobserver variability of index tests without reporting data on diagnostic performance. The diagnostic performance of an index test was considered high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity ≥ 94% with specificity ≥ 79%) or a triage test (sensitivity ≥ 95% with specificity ≥ 50%, or vice versa). We categorised as 'approaching' high accuracy imaging tests with diagnostic estimates within 5% of set thresholds. We considered all other diagnostic estimates as low.","Primary objectives To provide the estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis. Secondary objectives To investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for endometriosis. Potential sources of heterogeneity include the following. Characteristics of the study population: age (adolescence vs later reproductive years); clinical presentation (subfertility, pelvic pain, ovarian mass, asymptomatic women); stage of disease (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) classification system); geographic location of study. Histological confirmation in conjunction with laparoscopic visualisation versus laparoscopic visualisation alone. Changes in technology over time: year of publication; modifications applied to conventional imaging techniques. Methodological quality: differences in the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) evaluation (low vs unclear or high risk); consecutive versus non-consecutive enrolment; blinding of surgeons to results of index tests. Study design ('single gate design' vs 'two-gate design' studies).","The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. We reviewed information regarding interobserver and intraobserver correlation of the reference standard, if reported. We included only studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the index test, on the assumption that disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, naturally or as a result of treatment. We did not include in this review studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard, or for whom findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard. Summary of inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria Types of studies. Published peer-reviewed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Observational with prospective recruitment in the following design. ‘Single-gate design’ (single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation) - all participants had clinically suspected endometriosis. ‘Two-gate design’ (two sets of inclusion criteria with respect to clinical presentation and one set of inclusion criteria with respect to reference standard) - participants with or without clinical suspicion of endometriosis scheduled for abdominal surgery. Published in any language. Performed in any healthcare setting. Any sample size. Participants. Women of reproductive age. Women with clinically suspected endometriosis, including women who underwent abdominal surgery for other benign gynaecological conditions and surgical assessment for presence/absence of endometriosis. Those who undertook both index test and reference standard. Index tests. One or several types of imaging tests. Data reported in sufficient detail for construction of 2 × 2 tables and presented as 'participant-level' analysis. Target conditions. Pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma, DIE or specific pelvic sites of DIE. Reference standard. Surgical visualisation of lesions for the diagnosis of endometriosis (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological verification. Performed within 12 months of the index test. Exclusion criteria Types of studies. Narrative or systematic reviews. Retrospective design in which the index test was performed after execution of the reference test and/or participants were selected from a retrospective review of case notes. Case reports or case series. Conference proceedings. Participants. Included cohort was not representative of the target population that would benefit from the test (e.g. women with known genital tract malignancy, ectopic pregnancy, acute pelvic inflammatory disease). Study included participants of postmenopausal age, and data for the reproductive age group were not available in isolation. Only participants with positive index test or positive reference standard were included in the analysis. Index tests. Imaging tests were presented in combination with other diagnostic tests for endometriosis, and separate information was not available for the imaging modalities. Study presented only specific technical aspects of an index test or data on interobserver variability, rather than diagnostic performance of the test. Study presented only qualitative description of radiological appearance of endometriotic lesions. Only the number of lesions rather than the number of participants with endometriosis was reported (i.e. 'lesion-level' analyses). Target conditions. Endometriosis was not the primary outcome of the trial (e.g. malignant vs benign masses, normal vs abnormal pelvis). Atypical, rare sites of endometriosis. Reference standard. Reference standard performed only in a subset of study/control group. Findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard. Other than specified in inclusion criteria.","Investigators assessed three target conditions. Pelvic endometriosis: defined as endometrial tissue located within the pelvic cavity, including any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma): defined as ovarian cysts lined by endometrial tissue and appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size. DIE: defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, for example, when endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space for a distance of 5 mm or more. Posterior DIE is the most common form of DIE, and both conditions are interchangeably reported. For the purpose of this review, we combined them as a single target condition - DIE/posterior DIE. In addition, the ability of diagnostic imaging to map endometriotic lesions at specific anatomical pelvic locations was evaluated. Anatomical locations included rectovaginal septum (RVS), uterosacral ligament (USL), vaginal wall, POD obliteration, anterior DIE, rectosigmoid colon and the entire bowel from ileum to rectum. These locations are defined in Table 3. Table 3.  - types and anatomical distribution of endometriosis Type of endometriosis Description Main clinical types of endometriosis Pelvic endometriosis Endometriotic lesions, deep or superficial, located at any site in pelvic/abdominal cavity: on the peritoneum, fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, bowel, bladder or PODa Ovarian endometriosis Ovarian cysts lined by endometrial tissue (endometrioma) DIEb Deep endometriotic lesions extending more than 5 mm under the peritoneum located at any site of pelvic/abdominal cavity Subtypes of deep endometriosis per anatomical localisationc Posterior DIE Deep endometriotic lesions involve ≥ 1 site of the posterior pelvic compartment (USLd RVSe, vaginal wall, bowel) and/or obliterate PODa USLd endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrate uterosacral ligaments unilaterally or bilaterally RVSe endometriosis Deep endometriotic implants infiltrate the retroperitoneal area between posterior wall of vaginal mucosa and anterior wall of rectal muscularis Vaginal endometriosisf Endometriotic lesions infiltrate vaginal wall, particularly posterior vaginal fornix PODa obliteration Defined when the peritoneum of the PODa is only partially or no longer visible during surgery, and occurs as a result of adhesion formation; can be partial or complete, respectively Bowel endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrating at least the muscular layer of the intestinal wall ileum - rectum; predominantly affects rectosigmoid colon Rectosigmoid endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrating at least the muscular layer of the rectosigmoid colon; the most common form of bowel endometriosis Anterior DIE Deep endometriotic lesions located at any site of the anterior pelvic compartment (bladder ± anterior pouch) Rare types of endometriosis (not included in this review) Bladder endometriosis Endometriotic lesions infiltrating bladder muscularis propria Ureteral endometriosis Endometriotic lesions involving ureters Extrapelvic/Atypical endometriosis Rare types of endometriosis involving various sites outside pelvic cavity, such as: CNS: cerebral endometriosis, extradural spinal endometriosis Thoracic: pleural endometriosis, pulmonary endometriosis, diaphragmatic endometriosis Abdominal: hepatic endometriosis, renal endometriosis, appendix endometriosis, pancreas endometriosis Musculoskeletal: abdominal wall endometriosis, umbilical endometriosis, pyramidalis muscle endometriosis, inguinal endometriosis, canal of Nuck endometriosis Perianal endometriosis, perineal endometriosis, extrapelvic endometriosis of sciatic nerve Subcutaneous endometriosis, operative scar endometriosis aDIE: deep infiltrating endometriosis bPOD: pouch of Douglas cDefinitions of subtypes of DIE are adopted from Bazot 2007c. Additional definitions presented in the literature include 'Rectovaginal endometriosis (RVE)' defined as DIE that infiltrates the vagina, rectum and RVS and obliterates POD (Martin 2001) or 'deep retrocervical endometriosis' defined as involvement of USL, torus uterini, posterior vaginal fornix and/or RVS by endometriotic lesions (Abrao 2007). dUSL: uterosacral ligament eRVS: rectovaginal septum fVaginal endometriosis also defined as 'lesions infiltrating the anterior rectovaginal pouch, posterior vaginal fornix and retroperitoneal area between anterior rectovaginal pouch and posterior vaginal fornix (Chapron 2003a) Certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis were not included in this review because most of these were described in case reports or in case series, and laparoscopy and laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded studies in which the diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome of the trial (e.g. malignant vs benign masses, normal vs abnormal pelvis) and separate data for endometriosis were not available. We also excluded studies in which findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard because this was likely to distort any assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test. We included studies that involved only selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. at specific rASRM stages), in view of emerging evidence on poor correlation of this classification with infertility and pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. When possible, we addressed the impact of these studies in investigations of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported subgroup analyses of different stages of disease severity, we considered only estimates for the entire population because subgroup analyses do not directly address the review question regarding clinical utility of biomarkers in detecting the disease.","Study participants included women of reproductive age (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms and/or pelvic examination, who undertook both the index test and the reference standard.  were selected from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications: (1) clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination or a combination of these), (2) ovarian mass regardless of symptoms, (3) a mixed group, which consists of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass and/or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus). Articles that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when data for the reproductive age group were available in isolation. Studies were excluded when the study population involved participants who clearly would not undergo the index test in a clinical scenario and/or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies, gynaecological malignancies, acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications in which only a subset of participants with a positive index test or reference standard were included in the analysis, and data for the whole cohort were not available.","Published peer-reviewed studies that compared results of one or several types of imaging tests versus results obtained from a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. We included studies if they were: randomised controlled trials; observational studies of prospectively recruited women of the following designs: ‘single gate design’ (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis; or ‘two-gate design’ (studies in which participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two-gate studies were eligible only when all cases and controls belonged to the same population with respect to the reference standard (i.e. all participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005). performed in any healthcare setting; or published in any language; We did not impose a minimal limit on the number of participants in the included studies nor on the number of studies that have evaluated each index test. We excluded the following studies. Studies of specific study designs. Narrative or systematic review. Study of retrospective design when the index test was performed after execution of a reference test, or participants were selected through a retrospective review of case notes. Knowledge of the reference test could bias relatively subjective index tests. If endometriosis is found at a diagnostic surgical procedure, excision is commonly carried out concurrently, and this could bias the results of an index test performed after the reference standard. Case report or case series. Studies reported only in abstract form or in conference proceedings for which the full text was not available. This limitation was applied when we faced substantial difficulty in obtaining the information from abstracts, which precluded a reliable assessment of eligibility and methodological quality.","[25715375, 25322536, 25287563, 25007869, 24862965, 24828001, 24794315, 24777849, 24664128, 24449735, 24428703, 24287396, 24026621, 23754206, 24165087, 24045261, 24012208, 23716513, 23482338, 23233390, 22832144, 22744354, 8855093, 19467541, 19081567, 23444747, 23169738, 23123282, 22835943, 22693170, 22043830, 21822742, 21813257, 21497034, 21493029, 21968488, 21948683, 21656868, 21433168, 21351180, 21336537, 21285451, 21216125, 21159047, 21149318, 20171820, 20882634, 20503231, 20498532, 20380608, 20364253, 20356583, 20069680, 20023291, 19924468, 19568808, 19368917, 19685552, 19584256, 19457826, 19361320, 19263064, 19221097, 19202143, 19190961, 19161189, 19095669, 19019357, 18462722, 18235982, 19142523, 19106831, 18941070, 18664469, 18439504, 18382872, 18356454, 18310049, 18023444, 18001730, 17992706, 17947378, 17548084, 17420957, 17303630, 16937103, 16791463, 16583293, 16487194, 16427951, 15824947, 15705388, 15652900, 15346261, 15287056, 15287057, 15205479, 15192068, 15104831, 14628887, 12871883, 12749448, 12738499, 11704113, 11526774, 11251923, 11173733, 11026582, 10917184, 10863898, 10221244, 10207476, 9756308, 9688414, 9557832, 9491875, 9262273, 9201878, 9152194, 9091335, 8921082, 8752248, 8566251, 8576670, 7867272, 7736636, 7730461, 7699286, 7633100, 9050474, 8019364, 8010198, 8005309, 7926144, 8430177, 8421756, 8327693, 8224260, 2717740, 2717739, 3319386, 2930866, 6978008]","[25287563, 24862965, 24664128, 24449735, 24428703, 24287396, 22832144, 19467541, 22835943, 21497034, 21656868, 21433168, 21351180, 21285451, 20503231, 20364253, 20356583, 20023291, 19924468, 19584256, 19095669, 19019357, 18664469, 18439504, 18310049, 17947378, 17548084, 16937103, 15705388, 15652900, 12749448, 12738499, 11704113, 9557832, 9491875, 8752248, 8566251, 7699286, 7633100, 8010198, 8327693]"

For rifampicin resistance detection, the covariates of interest were Xpert MTB/RIF assay version and proportion of rifampicin resistant samples in the study (prevalence of rifampicin resistance in the study population).","For TB, acceptable reference standards used solid media (Löwenstein-Jensen, Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11, or Ogawa media) or a commercial liquid culture system, (such as BACTEC™ 460TB System or BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 Mycobacterial Detection System, BD, USA; BacT/ALERT® System, bioMérieux, France; or VersaTREK® Mycobacteria Detection & Susceptibility, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). For rifampicin resistance, the reference standards were phenotypic culture-based DST methods recommended by WHO (WHO Policy DST 2008). Acceptable methods were the proportion method performed on solid media (such as Löwenstein-Jensen, Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11, or Ogawa media), use of a commercial liquid culture system (such as BACTEC™ 460TB System or BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 Mycobacterial Detection System, BD, USA; BacT/ALERT® System, bioMérieux, France; or VersaTREK® Mycobacteria Detection & Susceptibility, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), or both.",The target conditions were active pulmonary TB and rifampicin resistance.,"We included studies that recruited adult or predominantly adult patients, aged 15 years or older, presumed to have pulmonary TB or MDR-TB, with or without HIV infection. Also, we included studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF using sputum and other respiratory specimens (such as fluid obtained from bronchial alveolar lavage and tracheal aspiration) consistent with the intended use of the manufacturer (Cepheid 2009), and studies from all types of health facilities and all laboratory levels (peripheral, intermediate, and central) from all countries. The majority of included studies provided data on the age of study participants. We considered it highly likely that studies that did not report age data involved all or mostly adults for the following reasons: the vast majority of specimens evaluated with Xpert MTB/RIF were sputum specimens and children have difficulty producing sputum; we excluded data on specimens obtained by gastric aspiration, as this specimen collection method is used mostly for investigating TB in children; we excluded studies that specifically evaluated the use of Xpert MTB/RIF in children; and we performed a sensitivity analysis by dropping studies that did not report age data to check whether the accuracy results changed Sensitivity analyses.","We included primary studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for both pulmonary TB and rifampicin resistance, or pulmonary TB alone. Diagnostic accuracy studies are typically cross-sectional in design. However, we also searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. We only included studies that reported data comparing Xpert MTB/RIF to an acceptable reference standard from which we could extract true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values. Xpert MTB/RIF could be assessed alone or together with other tests. We excluded studies with a case-control design because these types of studies are prone to bias, in particular, studies enrolling patients with severe disease and healthy participants without disease. We also excluded studies reported only in abstracts.","[23343418, 22531759, 21653771, 23188101, 23139799, 23044453, 23034211, 22981162, 22972826, 22970271, 22964006, 22905254, 22863872, 22855746, 22819240, 22815718, 22806590, 22752518, 22668906, 22629395, 22568711, 22555166, 22553234, 22474220, 22318975, 22241741, 22162564, 22139854, 22137551, 22075479, 21958145, 21943862, 21913741, 21865419, 21849695, 21836139, 21821179, 21821177, 21821176, 21818180, 21814497, 21814496, 21814495, 21682978, 21677069, 21653775, 21593262, 21507477, 21504402, 21493734, 21419061, 21411592, 21396219, 21341158, 21289151, 21270230, 21226593, 21191053, 21188551, 20964612, 20825313, 20720033, 19864480]","[21653771, 22972826, 22970271, 22863872, 22819240, 21943862, 21865419, 21849695, 21818180, 21814495, 21682978, 21677069, 21507477, 21493734, 21396219, 21341158, 21289151, 21191053, 20825313, 19864480]"
CD009647,"Clinical symptoms, signs and tests for identification of impending and current water-loss dehydration in older people","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of state (one time), minimally invasive clinical symptoms, signs and tests to be used as screening tests for detecting water-loss dehydration in older people by systematically reviewing studies that have measured a reference standard and at least one index test in people aged 65 years and over. Water-loss dehydration was defined primarily as including everyone with either impending or current water-loss dehydration (including all those with serum osmolality ≥ 295 mOsm/kg as being dehydrated).","Single clinical symptoms, signs and tests or a portfolio of symptoms, signs and/or tests and/or a checklist. Prespecified potential index tests for dehydration included dry axilla and other markers of transepidermal water loss; dry mucous membranes; dry or furrowed tongue; extended capillary refill time and measures of skin blood flow; poor sternal skin turgor; systolic blood pressure drop on standing; urine colour; USG; saliva osmolality; urine volume; sunken eyes; rapid pulse; postural pulse increment; postural dizziness; fluid balance charts; thirst; bad taste in the mouth; upper body weakness; measures of thermoregulation; bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA); and checklists of risk factors.  that appeared appropriate and so were included during the review process included drink and fluid intake; number of urine voids; urine osmolality; tear osmolality; tear volume or symptoms of dry eyes; saliva volume; cognitive and consciousness levels; feelings of tiredness or dullness; enjoyment of food and appetite; need for iv or thickened fluids and presence of blue lips. These index tests were included regardless of the definition of test positivity or cut-off chosen (and these sometimes did vary between studies). BIA assesses electrical impedance through the body (commonly from the fingers to the toes) and is often used to estimate body fat. Equipment is portable and fairly easy to use, and some types of BIA are theoretically able to assess TBW. BIA is in use in some areas in assessing hydration status of older people (especially those living in residential care). Different measurements can be made, including resistance (the resistance of the extracellular path through the body) and multi-frequency machines use take measurements at several different electrical frequencies. BIA machines may produce raw data on resistance and impedance, or use internal functions (incorporating information such as participant height, weight and age) to automatically calculate TBW and the extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW) components.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of state (one time), minimally invasive clinical symptoms, signs and tests to be used as screening tests for detecting water-loss dehydration in older people by systematically reviewing studies that have measured a reference standard and at least one index test in people aged 65 years and over. Water-loss dehydration was defined primarily as including everyone with either impending or current water-loss dehydration (including all those with serum osmolality ≥ 295 mOsm/kg as being dehydrated). Secondary objectives To assess the effect of different cut-offs of index test results assessed using continuous data on sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of water-loss dehydration. To identify clinical symptoms, signs and tests that may be used in screening for water-loss dehydration in older people. To identify clinical symptoms, signs and tests that are not useful in screening for water-loss dehydration in older people. To assess clinical symptoms, signs and tests of current dehydration (including all those with serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg). To assess clinical symptoms, signs and tests of impending dehydration (including all those with serum osmolality 295 to 300 mOsm/kg). To directly compare promising index tests (sensitivity ≥ 0.60 and specificity ≥ 0.75) where two or more are measured in a single study (direct comparison). To carry out an exploratory analysis to assess the value of combining the best three index tests where the three tests each have some predictive ability of their own, and individual studies include participants who had all three tests. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to explore sources of heterogeneity in the diagnostic accuracy of those individual clinical symptoms, signs and tests that showed some evidence of discrimination. Heterogeneity was to be explored according to the reference standard used, cut-off value for tests providing continuous data, type of participants (community-dwelling older people, those in residential care, and those in hospital), sex, and baseline prevalence of dehydration (Leeflang 2013).","Studies that used one of our reference standards for water‐loss dehydration, ordered in terms of their importance to make best use of the reference standard better able to represent water‐loss dehydration in frail older people, were included. The primary standard was raised plasma or serum osmolality, followed by serum osmolarity, then body mass (weight) change.  We have referred to those with either impending (serum osmolality 295 to 300 mOsm/kg) or current (serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg) dehydration as having water‐loss dehydration. Having water loss dehydration (having either impending or current dehydration, serum osmolality ≥ 295 mOsm/kg) has been contrasted with being euhydrated (serum osmolality 275 to  295 mOsm/kg) as our primary target condition.  The secondary target condition was current dehydration (serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg) compared with euhydration or impending dehydration (serum osmolality 275 to 300 mOsm/kg). We intended to assess another secondary target condition, impending dehydration alone (serum osmolality 295 to 300 mOsm/kg) compared to euhydration (serum osmolality 275 to  295 mOsm/kg), but these analyses were not carried out.  Serum or plasma osmolality  The primary target condition, water‐loss dehydration, included all those with serum or plasma osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg or greater (people with either impending or current dehydration)  Serum or plasma osmolality of 295 to 300 mOsmol/kg suggested impending water‐loss dehydration  Serum or plasma osmolality > 300 mOsmol/kg suggested current dehydration.  Serum osmolarity  We planned to use serum and plasma osmolality in the protocol, but during the review process it was decided to include serum osmolarity as a reference standard as it is an estimate of serum osmolality. Serum osmolarity is calculated from serum sodium, potassium, glucose and urea, rather than being directly measured. The exact formula used to calculate serum osmolarity has been noted for each study, and the cut‐offs used are the same as the cut‐offs for serum osmolality.  Body mass (weight) change  Weight change could be naturally occurring or follow encouragement to limit fluid intake for a period, but could not result from unusual levels of exercise or saunas (because these may result in dehydration that is metabolically distinct from naturally occurring dehydration). Weight change was included where a baseline weight was measured and re‐weighing occurred within seven days (and no surgery had occurred within that period).  We defined impending dehydration as a reduction of 3% to 5% of body weight within seven days or less, or an increase of 3% to 5% of body weight within seven days as an indication that a person was dehydrated before rehydration  Current dehydration corresponded to changes of more than 5% of body weight  Weight change over a period less than seven days was not multiplied up to the seven day equivalent.","Target conditions Water-loss dehydration (including people with either impending or current water-loss dehydration, anyone with a serum osmolality of ≥ 295 mOsm/kg) was the primary target condition. Impending water-loss dehydration (serum osmolality 295 to 300 mOsm/kg) and current water-loss dehydration (> 300 mOsm/kg), treated as two separate conditions, were planned as secondary target conditions.","People aged 65 years and over who were hospitalised, living in the community, or in institutions, in a developed country were included.  could not have kidney failure, cardiac (heart) failure, had not recently been prepared for surgery or undergone surgery, but may have had other chronic or acute illnesses, such as stroke, fracture, diabetes or infection. For mixed populations of older people that included participants aged under 65 years, we excluded participants aged less than 65 years where we had access to the full dataset; but, where only summary data were available, the study was only included where the proportion of those under 65 years was less than 10%. In the same way, when using published data we excluded studies with more than 10% of participants having one or more of the following: kidney failure, cardiac failure or a recent operation; and when using full study datasets, participants diagnosed with any of these conditions (according to individual study criteria) were excluded from analysis.","Diagnostic studies that compared an index test with a reference standard for water-loss dehydration in older people were included. We also considered cohort and cross-sectional studies that had not analysed diagnostic accuracy, but where at least one reference standard and at least one index test were measured in at least 10 participants aged 65 years or over and with at least two participants with water-loss dehydration and at least two participants without water-loss dehydration. These studies were included where the authors were able to provide a relevant 2 x 2 table comparing a reference with an index test, or a dataset from which relevant 2 x 2 tables could be calculated. Where we had access to the full study dataset we excluded any participants who did not receive both the index test and the reference standard.

Image acquisition and reporting variables were defined as listed above.,"To assess from the current literature the sensitivity of CT cerebral angiography as an additional confirmatory test for diagnosing death using neurological criteria, following satisfaction of clinical neurological criteria for brain death. Secondary objectives No secondary objective was examined.","The reference standard was the diagnosis of brain death, which is in effect the same as the target condition. In order to reduce heterogeneity, we recorded the clinical method used to diagnose brain death. We contacted authors or established the legal requirements in the country of article authorship, or both, to establish this. We originally considered performing subgroup analysis between cohorts diagnosed according to a 'no brainstem function' clinical method and those diagnosed according to a 'no brain or brainstem function' clinical method, but subsequent paucity of data precluded this possibility.",The target condition was the clinical diagnosis of brain death. Included studies needed to define the clinical method used to establish a diagnosis of brain death.,"We included patients in whom a diagnosis of brain death was suspected or in whom a clinical diagnosis of brain death had been made. We identified both adult and paediatric populations; this is consistent with the recommendations of the working party of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges 2008 that standard adult clinical criteria and testing can be used in those over two months of age to diagnose brain death. However, there are several physiological and procedural differences in the performance of CTA in the paediatric population, namely the volume of contrast administered (which is related to weight) and cardiac output. These factors may significantly affect the utility of CTA in the paediatric population and, therefore, we planned to analyse data for adult (over 16 years) and paediatric populations separately. No paediatric data were identified.","We included studies of patient populations, published in all languages. If relevant non-English articles were identified but full-text translations could not be obtained in press, we placed them in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section and sought help from colleagues within The Cochrane Collaboration to obtain accurate translations. We considered studies to be acceptable if: the studies compared cerebral CTA (with or without other imaging or ancillary tests) with a clinical diagnosis of brain death, that is satisfaction of accepted clinical neurological criteria to diagnose death; the participant population was defined as those in whom either a clinical diagnosis of brain death had already been made or a clinical diagnosis of brain death was established as part of the study; the absolute numbers of true and false positives, and true and false negatives, were either available directly from the published study data, secondarily derivable from data within the published study or as supplementary published material, or available directly from the original study authors. Although at the outset we sought to collect data regarding numbers of true negatives and false positives from studies, it rapidly became apparent from a preliminary review of the literature that all but one of the published studies included no control group. Other comparator tests were not reviewed as part of this study. We anticipated that many studies would include at least one other imaging or investigative comparator test; if these studies fulfilled our criteria for acceptance they were included.   In some studies, cerebral CTA may have been considered as a reference test and a further clinical test compared against it. Our search strategy was tailored to include these studies, however they were not included unless they provided a statement to the effect that 'all included patients satisfied a clinical diagnosis of brain death', or similar, allowing cerebral CTA to be viewed as an index test against the reference test of clinical testing.

Conventional diagnostic work-up consisted of physical and ultrasound examination, serum CA 125 measurement and/or CT or MRI scan.

CD009925,Second trimester serum tests for Down's Syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of second trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). We grouped our analyses to focus on investigating the value of adding increasing numbers of markers (comparing single, dual, triple and quadruple tests), and of including Inhibin A, the most recent routine addition to serum marker combinations. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We investigated whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.","The following index tests were examined; Alpha feto-protein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE3), total human chorionic gonadotropin (total hCG), free ß human chorionic gonadotropin (free β hCG), free alpha human chorionic gonadotropin (free α hCG), Inhibin A, SP2, CA125, Troponin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PGF) and proform of eosinophil major basic protein (ProMBP), and combinations of these markers combined with maternal age. Combinations without maternal age were not analysed, however, information on such test combinations is provided. We looked at comparisons of tests in isolation and in various combinations. These included single (one marker), double (two markers), triple (three markers), quadruple (four markers) and quintuple (five markers) test strategies, all maternal age-adjusted. We also looked at combinations that included Inhibin A as this has been the most recently routinely introduced marker. Where tests were used in comparison, we looked at the performance of test comparisons according to predicted probabilities computed using risk equations and dichotomised into high risk and low risk.","The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of second trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers.

We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.","We considered several reference standards, involving chromosomal verification and postnatal macroscopic inspection. Amniocentesis and CVS are invasive chromosomal verification tests undertaken during pregnancy. They are highly accurate, but the process carries a 1% miscarriage rate, and therefore they are only used in pregnancies considered to be at high risk of Down's syndrome, or on the mother's request. All other types of testing (postnatal examination, postnatal karyotyping, birth registers and Down’s syndrome registers) are based on information available at the end of pregnancy. The greatest concern is not their accuracy, but the loss of the pregnancy to miscarriage between the serum test and the reference standard. Miscarriage with cytogenetic testing of the fetus is included in the reference standard where available. We anticipated that older studies, and studies undertaken in older women are more likely to have used invasive chromosomal verification tests in all women. Studies undertaken in younger women and more recent studies were likely to use differential verification as they often only used prenatal karyotypic testing on fetuses considered screen positive/high risk according to the screening test; the reference standard for most unaffected infants being observing a phenotypically normal baby. Although the accuracy of this combined reference standard is considered high, it is methodologically a weaker approach as pregnancies that miscarry between the index test and birth are likely to be lost from the analysis, and miscarriage is more likely to occur in Down's than normal pregnancies. We investigated the impact of the likely missing false negative results in sensitivity analyses.","Down's syndrome in the fetus due to trisomy, translocation or mosaicism.","Pregnant women at between 14 and less than 24 weeks gestation confirmed by ultrasound, who had not undergone previous testing for Down’s syndrome in their pregnancy were eligible.

CD009944,Diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for the preoperative locoregional staging of primary gastric cancer,"To provide both a comprehensive overview and a quantitative analysis of the published data regarding the ability of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to preoperatively define the locoregional disease spread (i.e., primary tumor depth (T-stage) and regional lymph node status (N-stage)) in people with primary gastric carcinoma. Secondary objectives To provide the tools to calculate EUS diagnostic accuracy measures based on pre-test information, such as gastric cancer T-stage and N-stage prevalence (Bayes nomograms). To assess whether EUS performs differently in different subgroups of patients identified by the following parameters: year of publication, country (Western versus Eastern), EUS technical features (radial versus linear array; ultrasound frequency (MHz)), definition of target condition (for N-stage: lymph node morphology versus size), gastric tumor site (any site versus cardia region only) and prevalence of target condition.",The index test is EUS. We compared the results of EUS to those of pathology evaluation (reference test) in terms of both T-stage and N-stage (see Target conditions for more details). We did not consider any comparator test.,"To provide both a comprehensive overview and a quantitative analysis of the published data regarding the ability of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to preoperatively define the locoregional disease spread (i.e., primary tumor depth (T-stage) and regional lymph node status (N-stage)) in people with primary gastric carcinoma.  Secondary objectives To provide the tools to calculate EUS diagnostic accuracy measures based on pre-test information, such as gastric cancer T-stage and N-stage prevalence (Bayes nomograms). To assess whether EUS performs differently in different subgroups of patients identified by the following parameters: year of publication, country (Western versus Eastern), EUS technical features (radial versus linear array; ultrasound frequency (MHz)), definition of target condition (for N-stage: lymph node morphology versus size), gastric tumor site (any site versus cardia region only) and prevalence of target condition.","The reference standard was routine histopathology evaluation (i.e., microscopic examination of hematoxylin-eosin stained samples) of primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. Since pathological examination of the surgical specimen is the only way to know precisely the depth of invasion through the gastric wall as well as the status of regional lymph nodes, all eligible patients must have undergone surgery and all tumors must have undergone routine pathology evaluation. According to the pathology report, four T categories (T1 to T4) indicate the extent of gastric wall invasion by the primary tumor; the status of the regional lymph nodes (positive versus negative) was also taken into consideration.","The target condition was gastric cancer locoregional staging, for both primary tumor depth and regional lymph node status. For lymph node status (N-stage), we considered a patient either negative if no lymph node was metastatic (N0) or positive if one or more lymph nodes were metastatic (N+), as assessed by pathology evaluation. For the primary tumor invasion of the gastric wall (T-stage), we considered two main conditions according to the clinical questions that EUS aims to answer: In order to identify patients who would best benefit from surgery without preoperative radio-chemotherapy, EUS was to be investigated for its ability to distinguish superficial tumors (T1 - T2) versus advanced tumors (AGC, T3 - T4, which are likely to benefit from neoadjuvant preoperative chemotherapy); in this case, a patient was considered either positive if his/her gastric cancer was classified as T1 - T2 by pathology examination, or negative if his/her gastric cancer is classified as T3 - T4. Within the frame of superficial cancers (T1 - T2), in order to identify patients with superficial tumors amenable to endoscopic resection (T1 tumors), EUS was investigated for its ability to distinguish T1 tumors (EGC) versus T2 tumors; in this case, a patient was considered either positive if his/her gastric cancer is classified as T1 by pathology evaluation, or negative if his/her gastric cancer is classified as T2. Finally, where the data permitted and within the frame of EGC (T1 tumors), EUS was also tested for its ability to further discriminate between T1a and T1b tumors, since it is believed that the former type of cancers benefit the most from endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). To this end, a patient was considered either positive if his/her gastric cancer was classified as T1a by pathology evaluation, or negative if his/her gastric cancer was classified as T1b.","For this review, patients were people with gastric carcinoma undergoing preoperative locoregional disease staging (T-stage and N-stage) by means of EUS and postoperative pathology evaluation of the surgical specimen, including those having early gastric cancer (EGC) or advanced gastric cancer (AGC). We imposed no restrictions by age, gender or any other category.","We include studies that meet the following inclusion criteria: A minimum sample size of 10 patients with histologically-proven primary carcinoma of the stomach; Evaluation of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) compared with histopathology of primary tumor (T-stage) and regional lymph nodes (N-stage); Sufficient data to construct a two-by-two contingency table such that the cells in the table could be labeled as true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative (see the Target conditions for more details). This type of study typically include both retrospective and prospective series of patients. As long as the above information is available,we did not exclude any specific type of study design. We excluded studies that had possible overlap with the selected studies (i.e. studies from the same study group, institution, and period of inclusion). We excluded studies reporting on EUS performed before preoperative chemotherapy and or radiotherapy (neoadjuvant therapy) in order to avoid the confounding effect of disease downstaging by neoadjuvant treatments.","[23015224, 15229425, 9831834, 9786108, 1511822, 8365619, 15114303, 10502181, 22528672, 22166314, 21940574, 21824594, 21725509, 21519368, 21424074, 21278579, 20734082, 20652857, 20617861, 20370729, 20074167, 19585066, 19228527, 19077733, 18937292, 18337043, 19031933, 18774355, 18251793, 17963876, 17903735, 17636525, 17465457, 17357856, 17180286, 18080789, 17069595, 17054580, 17048994, 16996338, 16896560, 16817044, 16446988, 16440415, 16121346, 15773837, 15520913, 15254045, 15243885, 14752658, 14752188, 14630513, 12647078, 12532442, 12592099, 12471541, 12352295, 11950802, 11809546, 11080410, 11041028, 10919057, 10861417, 10855851, 10556006, 10486372, 10445558, 10408157, 10193939, 10026321, 9765088, 9755399, 9584569, 9378206, 9245882, 9245881, 8939844, 8875868, 8826718, 8799392, 8688702, 7940168, 7712983, 8519241, 8491133, 8467967, 8417483, 1732981, 1633773, 1463259, 2040468, 1924784, 1871669, 1860438, 2696138, 2688069, 2687144, 3070801]","[15229425, 9831834, 9786108, 15114303, 10502181, 22528672, 22166314, 21940574, 21824594, 21725509, 20734082, 20652857, 20617861, 20370729, 20074167, 19077733, 18937292, 18337043, 18774355, 18251793, 17963876, 17903735, 17465457, 17357856, 18080789, 17054580, 17048994, 16817044, 16446988, 16440415, 16121346, 15243885, 14752658, 14752188, 12532442, 12471541, 12352295, 11080410, 10919057, 10855851, 10556006, 10486372, 10445558, 10408157, 10026321, 9755399, 9378206, 9245881, 8875868, 8799392, 8688702, 7712983, 8519241, 8491133, 8417483, 1463259, 2040468, 1924784, 1871669, 3070801]"

An abnormal lucent line within the scaphoid is considered evidence of a fracture. The use of two index tests. If both are positive or negative, a final diagnosis is obtained. In addition, clinical findings are often combined with an index test or repeated radiographs obtained after six weeks to formulate a reference standard. The use of only one of the second-line modalities has been described; this is somewhat unsatisfactory because these diagnostic techniques are still under study.  We considered six-week follow-up radiographs (1) the most suitable reference standard. Next we considered the use of two index tests with the same outcome and one index test including clinical findings (2 and 3). Although we considered the fourth option to be suboptimal, it was included in the review. We did not include studies using clinical findings only six to 14 weeks after trauma or the single use of one- to two-week follow-up radiographs as a reference standard as we consider these inadequate.","Clinically suspected scaphoid fractures (which could be proximal, waist or distal) with negative plain radiographs.","People of all ages who presented at hospital or clinic within one week of trauma with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and negative post-trauma radiographs. Clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture is based on pain in the anatomical snuffbox or by longitudinal compression of the thumb, or both. The radiographs generally include two images of the wrist (postero-anterior and lateral views) and at least one of two additional scaphoid views.",All prospective or retrospective studies involving a consecutive series of patients.

The COE (conventional testing test) was the initial point of the screen, which all individuals received.

At the most experienced level this would be an oral and maxillofacial pathologist or oral medicine specialist possibly utilising biopsy with histology where considered clinically appropriate. More commonly this was expected to include general dental physicians in receipt of supplementary training in the detection and identification of PMD and carcinoma of the lip or oral cavity or other physicians with dedicated training. We included studies where confirmation of individuals screened negative by the index test was done by extended follow-up. To be eligible for inclusion in the review, at least a proportion of the screened negatives were required to be verified. Where reported, for each study we noted the diagnostic protocol, guidelines or registry used for follow-up in the Characteristics of included studies table.

CD010213,Imaging modalities for characterising focal pancreatic lesions,To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of various imaging modalities in detecting cancerous and precancerous lesions in people with focal pancreatic lesions.,"CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, EUS, EUS elastography, and EUS-guided biopsy either alone or in combination as replacement for major surgery for diagnostic purposes. We accepted the criteria stated by the authors to classify the lesion as benign, precancerous, and cancerous for different imaging modalities. There is no standard algorithm in the diagnosis or management of focal pancreatic lesions. Other tests that may be used in the diagnosis of focal pancreatic lesions include diagnostic laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, serum levels of CA 19-9, and surgical resection (surgical resection may be considered diagnostic when the diagnosis is uncertain after all other diagnostic modalities have been attempted).","To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of various imaging modalities in detecting cancerous and precancerous lesions in people with focal pancreatic lesions. Secondary objectives We planned to explore the following sources of heterogeneity. Studies at low risk of bias versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool as recommended by the Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Tests Methods Group) (Whiting 2006). In particular, we considered the studies classified as 'yes' for the items differential verification, un-interpretable results, and withdrawals as the most important sources of heterogeneity. Full-text publications versus abstracts (this might be indicative of publication bias, since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication) (Eloubeidi 2001). Prospective studies versus retrospective studies. Different types of reference standard. Symptomatic versus asymptomatic lesions (the presence of symptoms may increase the pre-test probability). Solid versus cystic lesions (as the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging modalities may vary depending upon whether the lesion is solid or cystic). Participants with chronic pancreatitis versus those without chronic pancreatitis. Different criteria used by the authors to classify the lesions. Single imaging versus sequential imaging (repeated imaging). Different intervals of sequential imaging (e.g. imaging every six months versus annual review).","We accepted the following reference standards. Histopathological examination of the entire lesion by surgical resection (gold standard). This classified the lesion as benign, precancerous, or cancerous. Histopathological examination (irrespective of how the tissues were obtained for histopathological examination) in people with positive test (for cancerous or precancerous lesions) and clinical follow-up by a doctor (with or without sequential follow-up with imaging but using appropriate criteria such as metastases or confirmation of cancer by biopsy or death of participants due to cancer) of all participants with negative test for a period of at least six months and for a maximum period of 24 months. Until a definitive diagnosis is available, percutaneous biopsy is generally avoided because of the fear of seeding of cancer cells in potentially resectable cancers. As anticipated, the tissues obtained for histopathological examination were obtained from surgical resection. It is unlikely that patients with a low likelihood for cancer based on clinical symptoms and signs and test results (may include the results of index test) are subject to surgery or biopsy. Even if a biopsy is performed in such patients, a cancerous or precancerous lesion cannot be ruled out because of sampling error. Consequently, such patients are usually followed up clinically with sequential imaging. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma will cause clinical deterioration or increase in tumour size during a period of six months, and so we accepted clinical follow-up or sequential follow-up imaging (irrespective of the modality of the imaging) of all participants with a negative biopsy or no biopsy for at least six months as one of the reference standards. However, we accepted clinical follow-up as a reference standard only when the criteria used for diagnosis were appropriate (e.g. identification of metastases, later biopsy of the lesion confirming the nature of the lesion, and death of participants due to cancer). The choice of a maximum period of 24 months was an arbitrary choice based on the low probability of precancerous lesions becoming cancerous during 24 months. Clinical follow-up of patients is unlikely to classify precancerous lesions correctly since patients are unlikely to develop metastases or die within this interval.",Benign versus precancerous and cancerous lesions (including the type of cancerous lesion). Benign and precancerous versus cancerous lesions.,Adults with focal pancreatic lesions.,"We included studies reporting on cross-sectional information of the index test and reference test in the appropriate patient population (see below), irrespective of language or publication status or whether the data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

The CDUS is a non-invasive, non-expensive, easy-to-use instrument for endoleak detection. CDUS depends on the experience of the operator and provides limited images for independent review by others. CE-CDUS requires an intravenous injection with a contrast which consists of microbubbles that resonate when examined with sound of low intensity.

Secondary objectives The secondary objective of this review is to investigate variation in the diagnostic accuracy of ERCP and IOC according to the following potential sources of heterogeneity. Studies at low risk of bias versus studies with unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool (Table 1)). Table 1. The QUADAS 2 tool for assessing methodological quality of included studies Domain 1: Participant sampling Signalling question Signalling question Signalling question Risk of bias Concerns for applicability Domain 1: Participant sampling Patient sampling Was a consecutive or random sample of participants enrolled? Was a case-control design avoided? Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? Could the selection of participants have introduced bias? Were there concerns that the included participants and setting did not match the review question? Yes: all consecutive participants or random sample of participants with suspected common bile duct stones were enrolled. No: selected participants were enrolled. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Yes: case-control design was avoided. No: case-control design was not avoided. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Yes: the study avoided inappropriate exclusions (i.e., people who were difficult to diagnose). No: the study excluded participants inappropriately. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Low risk: 'yes' for all signalling questions. High risk: 'no' or 'unclear' for at least 1 signalling question. Low concern: the selected participants represent the people in whom the tests would be used in clinical practice (see diagnostic pathway ( Figure 1). High concern: there was high concern that participant selection was performed in a such a way that the included participants did not represent the people in whom the tests will be used in clinical practice. Domain 2: Index test Index test(s) Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard? If a threshold was used, was it pre-specified? - Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias? Were there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or its interpretation differed from the review question? Yes: index test results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard. No: index test results were interpreted with knowledge of the results of the reference standard. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Yes: if the criteria for a positive test result were pre-specified. No: if the criteria for a positive test result were not pre-specified. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. - Low risk: 'yes' for all signalling questions. High risk: 'no' or 'unclear' for at least 1 of the 2 signalling questions. High concern: there was high concern that the conduct or interpretation of the index test differed from the way it is likely to be used in clinical practice. Low concern: there was low concern that the conduct or interpretation of the index test differed from the way it is likely to be used in clinical practice. Domain 3: Reference standard Target condition and reference standard(s) Was the reference standard likely to classify the target condition correctly? Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index tests? - Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias? Were there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard did not match the review question? Yes: all participants underwent the acceptable reference standard. No: if all participants did not undergo an acceptable reference standard. Such studies were excluded from the review. Unclear: if the reference standard that the participants underwent was not stated. Such studies were excluded from the review. Yes: reference standard results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test. No: reference standard results were interpreted with the knowledge of the results of the index test. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. - Low risk: 'yes' for all signalling questions. High risk: 'no' or 'unclear' for at least 1 of the 2 signalling questions. Low concern: participants underwent endoscopic or surgical exploration for common bile duct stone. High concern: no participants underwent endoscopic or surgical exploration for common bile duct stone. Domain 4: Flow and timing Flow and timing Was there an appropriate interval between index test and reference standard? Did all participants receive the same reference standard? Were all participants included in the analysis? Could the participant flow have introduced bias? - Yes: the interval between index test and reference standard (including any repeat procedures) was ≤ 4 weeks (arbitrary choice). No: the interval between index test and reference standard was > 4 weeks. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Yes: all participants underwent endoscopic or surgical exploration for common bile duct stone irrespective of the index test results. No: participants underwent endoscopic or surgical exploration if the index test results were positive and underwent clinical follow-up for at least 6 months if the index test results were negative. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Such studies were excluded. Yes: all participants meeting the selection criteria (selected participants) were included in the analysis, or data on all the selected participants were available so that a 2 x 2 table including all selected participants could be constructed. No: not all participants meeting the selection criteria were included in the analysis or the 2 x 2 table could not be constructed using data on all selected participants. Unclear: this was not clear from the report. Low risk: 'yes' for all signalling questions. High risk: 'no' or 'unclear' for at least 1 signalling question. - Full-text publications versus abstracts (this may indicate publication bias if there is an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication) (Eloubeidi 2001). Prospective versus retrospective design. Symptomatic versus asymptomatic common bile duct stones (the presence of symptoms may increase the pre-test probability). People with symptoms were defined as people showing upper right quadrant abdominal pain, jaundice, acute cholangitis, or acute pancreatitis (Anciaux 1986; Roston 1997; Raraty 1998; Toh 2000; Tranter 2003). Prevalence of common bile duct stones in each included study. The prevalence of common bile duct stones in the population analysed by each included study may vary and cause heterogeneity. Prevalence may also change with people with co-morbidities that would predispose them to common bile duct stones, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, Caroli's disease, hypercholesterolaemia, sickle cell anaemia, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Proportion of people with previous cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy may cause dilation of the common bile duct (Benjaminov 2013), and subsequently change the accuracy of the index test particularly imaging modalities. Proportion of people with common bile duct strictures (only for index tests that use contrast material, as strictures may prevent contrast material filling the common bile duct completely and, therefore, change the accuracy of the index test). MRCP or EUS, if performed, prior to the index test.","We accepted the following reference standard. For test positives, we accepted confirmation of a common bile duct stone by extraction of the stone (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods). For test negatives, we acknowledged that there was no way of being sure that there were no common bile duct stones. However, we accepted negative results by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months as the reference standard. Surgical or endoscopic exploration s adequate, but it is not commonly used in people with negative index tests because of its invasive nature. Therefore, we accepted follow-up as a less adequate reference test. Negative exploration of common bile duct is likely to be a better reference standard than follow-up for at least six months since most stones already present in the common bile duct are likely to be extracted in this fashion. Six months is an arbitrary choice, but we anticipated most common bile duct stones will become manifest during this period.",Common bile duct stones.,"People at risk of or suspected of having common bile duct stones, with or without prior diagnosis of cholelithiasis; with or without symptoms and complications of common bile duct stones, with or without prior treatment for common bile duct stones; and before or after cholecystectomy.","We included studies providing cross-sectional information comparing one or more of the index tests against a reference standard in the appropriate patient population (see Participants).

CD010386,11C-PIB-PET for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the 11C- PIB-PET scan as the index test for detecting participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or other forms of dementia at follow-up.,11C-PIB-PET imaging test We used the criteria that were applied in each included primary study to classify participants as either 11C-PIB positive or 11C-PIB negative. We considered positivity as 11C-PIB ligand uptake and retention exceeding a certain threshold.,To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the 11C- PIB-PET scan as the index test for detecting participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or other forms of dementia at follow-up. Secondary objectives To investigate the heterogeneity of the test accuracy in the included studies.,"The reference standard was progression to the target conditions. For the purpose of this review, several definitions of ADD were acceptable. Included studies applied probable or possible National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria (McKhann 1984). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health Organization 2010) definitions for ADD were also acceptable. Similarly, differing clinical definitions of other dementias were acceptable. For Lewy body dementia the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2005); for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) the Lund criteria (Neary 1988; Brun 1994; Boxer 2005), DSM (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994), ICD (World Health Organization 2010); and for vascular dementia the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherché et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS ARIEN) criteria (Roman 1993), DSM (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994), and ICD (World Health Organization 2010). The time interval over which progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia occurred is very important. We chose one year as the minimum period of delay in the verification of the diagnosis (that is the time between the assessment at which a diagnosis of MCI is made and the assessment at which the diagnosis of dementia is made). We planned to segment analyses into separate follow-up mean periods for the delay in verification: one year to less than two years; two to less than four years; and greater than four years. In this eventuality we planned to clearly note where the same included studies contributed to the analysis for more than one reference standard follow-up interval.",There were two target conditions in this review: Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) (conversion from MCI to ADD); Any other forms of dementia (conversion from MCI to any other forms of dementia).,"recruited and clinically classified as those with MCI at baseline were eligible for this review. The diagnosis of MCI was established using the Petersen criteria or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen 1999; Petersen 2004; Winblad 2004), the Matthews 2008 criteria, or CDR = 0.5 (Morris 1993), or a combination. These criteria include: subjective complaints; a decline in memory objectively verified by neuropsychological testing in combination with a history from the patient; a decline in other cognitive domains; no or minimal impairment of activities of daily living; not meeting the criteria for dementia. Therefore, the eligible participants had a number of tests, for example neuropsychological tests for cognitive deficit and checklists for activities of daily living, prior to study entry.  in some studies were defined as amnestic single domain, amnestic multiple domain, non-amnestic single domain, non-amnestic multiple domain, or non-specified MCI participants. We considered these studies for inclusion. We also considered studies without reference to a particular source of recruitment (participant setting) for inclusion. We excluded studies that involved patients with MCI possibly caused by: i) current or a history of alcohol or drug abuse; ii) central nervous system (CNS) trauma (for example subdural haematoma), tumour, or infection; iii) other neurological conditions (for example Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases).","We considered longitudinal studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI with baseline 11C-PIB-PET scan and the reference standard results obtained at follow-up (see Index tests and Reference standards below). These studies necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia and are sometimes labelled as 'delayed verification cross-sectional studies' (Knotnerus 2002; Bossuyt 2008).  We included case control studies when they incorporated a delayed verification design. This occurred in the context of a cohort study, so these studies are invariably diagnostic nested case-control studies.","[22961445, 20176414]",[22961445]
CD010409,Sentinel node assessment for diagnosis of groin lymph node involvement in vulval cancer,To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of various techniques using traceable agents for sentinel lymph node assessment to diagnose groin lymph node metastasis in women with FIGO stage IB or higher vulval cancer and to investigate sources of heterogeneity.,"Tracer agents used to identify sentinel nodes for histological assessment. We expected that trial reports should specify accurately the technique used and include the following: Description of agent Technique, amount, location and timing of injection of agent Method used to trace and detect sentinel node Definition of what was regarded as a sentinel node Description of the histological method used to assess the sentinel node A sentinel node should have been defined as the first lymph node that showed adequate concentration of tracing agent (e.g. greatest radioactive signal in groin basin detected on hand-held gamma probe in case of radioactive tracer agent, or a node that appeared visually blue intra-operatively) (de Hullu 1998). The sentinel node should then have been removed and subjected to standard histological examination or by frozen section with at least haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. If the sentinel node was found to be malignant, it was defined as a positive sentinel node. If a sentinel node did not show any malignancy, it was defined as a negative sentinel node. If a sentinel node could not be identified, it was defined as 'failure to detect sentinel node' (and not index test negative). Details of reason for failure to detect sentinel nodes should also have been reported where possible, along with the outcome of lymph node status on reference standard. A complete groin lymph node dissection (IFL) would include the sentinel node in the specimen, thus creating a situation where the index test result becomes part of the reference standard (incorporation). Realistically, therefore, false positive tests would not exist in this situation (see Figure 2). In an event where the sentinel node was identified, assessed and deemed histologically positive but the remaining groin nodes were negative, the index test would still be regarded as a true positive. We did not anticipate that false positive tests would be reported in the included studies, but if we encountered them, unless further information was available from the author to create a protocol-compliant two-by-two table, we planned to exclude them from the review.

(A) Negative sentinel and rest of the groin nodes (True negative), (B) Positive sentinel node but negative rest of the groin nodes (True positive), (C) Positive sentinel and groin nodes (True positive) and (D) Negative sentinel but positive groin nodes (False negative) We anticipated that many studies would report a combination of various sentinel node assessment techniques (mixed tests). When analysing the diagnostic test accuracy of a single technique, we only included these studies in the analyses if a separate two-by-two table for the technique in question could be constituted. Similarly, not all women received combined techniques (i.e. blue dye and technetium) in these studies. When analysing the diagnostic test accuracy of the combined technique, these studies were only included in the analyses if all cases received the combined technique in question, or a separate two-by-two table for cases who received the combined technique in question could be constituted. Where possible, we attempted to obtain separate diagnostic test accuracy data from investigators of studies in which different index test data had been combined. Figure 2.

The reference standard was to be subjected to the standard histological assessment with at least H staining. If any of the removed nodes (including the sentinel node) showed cancer metastasis histologically, the reference standard was considered positive. Studies were to report the reference standard result by each side of groin node removal or by women/cases.  Systematic groin lymph node removal includes removal of inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. Traditionally this includes removal of lymph nodes above and parallel to the inguinal ligament up to the pubic tubercle medially and lymph nodes from the femoral triangle (parallel to femoral vessels and sapheno‐femoral junction including cribriform fascia) up to and including the deep fascia of muscle forming the base of the femoral triangle. Dissection deeper to the deep fascia or into the adductor canal is usually not required. However, there remains some uncertainty regarding the ideal extent and adequacy of surgical dissection (Hudson 2004).",Target conditions Groin (inguinofemoral) lymph node metastases in FIGO stage IB or higher vulval cancer.,"Women diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB or higher vulval cancer without clinically suspicious nodes.

We included studies that reported the number of sentinel node procedures (each side counted separately; so-called 'per groin' data) and the number of women who underwent a sentinel node procedure (whereby a bilateral sentinel node procedure was reported as one case; so-called 'per woman' data), provided that we could construct two-by-two tables of these data. We excluded studies reporting fewer than 10 sentinel node procedures, as well as studies for which construction of a two-by-two table for either 'per groin' or 'per woman' data was not possible. For studies that included women with clinically suspicious, palpable or metastases-positive groin nodes, we attempted to exclude these women from the extracted data. Where this was not possible, we excluded studies in which these cases exceeded 10% of the total numbers of women or groins assessed.","[23201592, 22753905, 22503824, 21997173, 21782373, 21465249, 21056907, 19922986, 19922838, 19824870, 19573313, 19192665, 18804850, 18582920, 18383894, 18255128, 18215758, 17626265, 17291246, 17006693, 16246399, 16216321, 16437399, 15924522, 15790451, 14674132, 14599869, 14515864, 12893229, 12583366, 12504623, 12192565, 11905414, 11855886, 11725728, 11702099, 11016730, 10920128, 10920125, 10831370, 10646880, 10523690, 10071668, 9708512, 9698476, 7590476, 8041523, 1526513]","[23201592, 22753905, 22503824, 21782373, 21465249, 19922986, 19922838, 19573313, 18804850, 18582920, 17626265, 17291246, 17006693, 16437399, 15790451, 14674132, 12893229, 12504623, 12192565, 11855886, 11016730, 10920128, 10646880, 10071668, 9708512, 7590476, 8041523]"

Thresholds are indicated in Table 1.","The objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry for TIC in adult trauma patients with bleeding, using a reference standard of Prothrombin Time ratio and/or the International Normalized Ratio.","In the absence of embedded clinical consensus, we used a coagulopathic range based on PTr/INR; the lower limit of the coagulopathic range being a PTr/INR reading of 1.2 or greater (Frith 2010), and the higher limit of the coagulopathic range being a PTr/INR reading of 1.5 or greater (Stainsby 2006). There is no upper threshold: anyone with a PTr/INR count of above 1.2, or above 1.5, is considered coagulopathic. These figures were reached through discussion by the report authors, including experts in haematology and trauma medicine. PTr differs from INR, although the final numbers may be the same. The PTr calculated varies according to local thresholds and separate batches of different manufacturers' reagent involved in conducting the prothrombin time test. In an effort to standardise this measurement, the INR is calculated as the ratio of a patient’s PTr compared to a mean normal PTr (calculated by determining the mean of 30 or more patients who are representative of the local hospital population), computed to the power of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI), which is itself calculated by the manufacturer, to give an indication of how each batch of tissue factor corresponds to an international reference.

CD010542,Transient elastography for diagnosis of stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography for diagnosis and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. In addition, to identify the optimal cut-off values for differentiating the five stages of hepatic fibrosis.","Transient elastography, a non-invasive test measuring liver stiffness in kiloPascals (kPa). Following the recommended technical parameters for transient elastography and to ensure the validity of the transient elastography result for every participant in the single studies, participants should have undergone at least 10 validated stiffness measurements at the same measurement point. The measurements should have had an interquartile range of 30% or less, and the ratio of the number of successful measurements to the total number of acquisitions should have been 60% or less (Echosens 2009). We only considered data from people who provided the full set of the described data. Transient elastography is not recommended for use in pregnant women, people with pacemakers, and people with ascites. Factors that may influence the success of transient elastography investigation are experience of the operator and body mass index of the person. Liver stiffness measurement can produce biased results depending on the grade of necro-inflammation and grade of steatosis (Myers 2010).","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography for diagnosis and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. In addition, to identify the optimal cut-off values for differentiating the five stages of hepatic fibrosis.","Liver biopsy is the reference standard that is obtained by percutaneous needle techniques, transjugular method, ultrasound-guided fine-needle, or surgical specimens (Kuntz 2008; Ivashkin 2011b). Liver biopsy is the only existing reference standard so far for diagnosing hepatic fibrosis stages in people with alcoholic liver disease. Specimens of liver tissue with a mean length of at least 15 mm and at least seven portal tracts are among the factors that can provide reliable morphological staging of hepatic fibrosis and grading of inflammation (Rockey 2009). If liver biopsy samples were reported with any of the semi-quantitative scores, that is, METAVIR (Franciscus 2007), Knodell (Franciscus 2007), Ishak (Franciscus 2007), Kleiner (Kleiner 2005), Scheuer (Regev 2002), Brunt (Brunt 1999), or Batts-Ludwig (Haque 2010), we used a conversion grid for hepatic fibrosis staging adapted after Goodman 2007 (Table 1) to unify results on the grade of hepatic fibrosis on liver biopsy. For grading alcoholic steatosis, we used the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network scoring system (Kleiner 2005) (Table 2). Table 2.

Based on the METAVIR histopathological score for interpreting liver biopsy, there are five stages of hepatic fibrosis (Table 1). F0: no fibrosis. F1: mild fibrosis. F2: significant fibrosis. F3: severe fibrosis. F4: cirrhosis. We dichotomised the hepatic fibrosis estimated by the METAVIR score as follows: people with METAVIR score of F1 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 are considered 'non-diseased'; people with METAVIR score of F2 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 are considered 'non-diseased'; people with METAVIR score of F3 or worse were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 are considered 'non-diseased'; people with METAVIR score of F4 were considered 'diseased' and people with METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 plus F3 are considered 'non-diseased'.","The studies had to include participants of any sex and ethnic origin, above 16 years old, and diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease. The participants could have been hospitalised or managed as outpatients. The diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease in the study participants had to be established based on registered history of excessive intake of alcohol of sufficient duration and quantity together with clinical evidence of liver disease expressed with physical signs at examination and followed by laboratory evidence of liver disease. To ascertain the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease and study the presence or absence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, the studies had to perform both transient elastography and liver biopsy (Bouchier 1992). For this review, we did not consider for inclusion data on participants diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease and having a concomitant liver disease such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis C virus infection, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, autoimmune liver disease, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We extracted data on study participants with alcoholic liver disease alone whenever such data were available in the study report or whenever we could obtain the data required for the review through personal communication with study authors. In the latter case, we disregarded some of the data presented in the publication and used the data provided by the study authors through personal communication.","We sought to include diagnostic cohort studies and diagnostic case-control studies that had assessed hepatic fibrosis in participants with alcoholic liver disease through transient elastography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

CD010632,18F-FDG PET for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ¹⁸F-FDG-PET index test for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to ADD or other forms of dementia at follow-up. Although we want to identify whether 'early forms of Alzheimer's disease dementia' are present at the moment of examination, there is no reference standard to make a final diagnosis of early ADD. Follow-up is therefore needed to reconstruct what was going on at the time of the index examination. In this context, it is clear that the duration of follow-up becomes critical, i.e. sufficiently long to capture the natural course of conversion.","¹⁸F-FDG PET biomarker test There are currently no generally accepted standards for a ¹⁸F-FDG positivity threshold, and therefore we have used the criteria which were applied in each included primary study to classify participants as either ¹⁸F-FDG-positive or ¹⁸F-FDG-negative, according to the degree of glucose metabolism in selected brain regions. Some studies apply a qualitative assessment of PET scans, while some apply both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Moreover, different thresholds are used in quantitative studies. While this may generate heterogeneity it should be noted that the addition of quantitative analysis (in the interpretation of the ¹⁸F-FDG PET brain scan) in clinical practice is done in order to support the visual (qualitative) reading of the scan by the physician. A range of thresholds have been used in primary research, for instance: i) ""the regional cerebral glucose metabolism ratio (rCGM-r) is lower than 80% of whole brain mean of control subjects"" (Chételat 2003); ii) ""the rCGM-r of temporo-parietal and posterior cingulate < 1.3 - 8"" (Anchisi 2005). We considered the use of any image analysis technique, ¹⁸F-FDG injection dose, the time between ¹⁸F-FDG injection and PET acquisition, and ¹⁸F-FDG reduction regions (e.g. parietal, temporal, frontal lobes, posterior cingulated, precuneus). The exact administered ¹⁸F-FDG activity does not affect the PET examination (as long as it ranges between the accepted limits for acquiring proper images), as this can be compensated for by the duration of the scan; the number of counts detected by the scanner is the key finding. The accepted limits of administered activity are defined by guidelines published by the Nuclear Medicine Societies. The two major ones are the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM, USA) (Waxman 2009) and the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM, Europe) (Varrone 2009). According to SNM, the recommended ¹⁸F-FDG activity in adults for brain PET is 185 - 740 MBq (or 5 - 20 mCi). According to EANM, the recommended administered activity for adults is 300 – 600 MBq (typically 370 MBq) in 2D mode and 125 – 250 MBq (typically 150 MBq) in 3D mode. All studies included in this review demonstrated homogeneity in the protocol followed, with no substantial differences, regarding administered dose or scanning acquisition followed. Moreover, despite the between-studies differences regarding interpretation criteria, the evaluation of the PET scans was based on the fundamental principle of detection of a pattern of brain hypometabolism (decreased ¹⁸F-FDG uptake) in people with MCI that is topographically consistent with the respective hypometabolic pattern expected to be seen in ADD. This means detection of regional metabolic reductions mainly in the temporo-parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. The differences in exact timing of image acquisition also do not influence the study, as long as the acquisition does not start earlier than 30 minutes after ¹⁸F-FDG injection. It is recommended, however, that each department follow a standard protocol with a fixed time for starting the acquisition (e.g. 30 or 60 minutes after injection) (Varrone 2009; Waxman 2009). The aim of the acquisition is the good contrast between grey and white matter. We did not include any comparator test because there are currently no standard practice tests available for the diagnosis of dementia. We compared the index test with a reference standard.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ¹⁸F-FDG-PET index test for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to ADD or other forms of dementia at follow-up.

Follow-up is therefore needed to reconstruct what was going on at the time of the index examination. In this context, it is clear that the duration of follow-up becomes critical, i.e. sufficiently long to capture the natural course of conversion. Secondary objectives To investigate heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies. We expect that heterogeneity will be likely and that it will be an important component of the review. The potential sources of heterogeneity, which we will use as a framework for the investigation of heterogeneity, include target population, index test, target disorder and study quality.","For the purpose of this review, several definitions of ADD are acceptable. We Included studies that applied probable or possible NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann 1984). We also considered those studies that used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA 1987; APA 1994) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-10 2010) definitions for ADD. Similarly, differing clinical definitions of other dementias are acceptable. For Lewy body dementia the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2006). For fronto-temporal dementia the reference standards are the Lund criteria (Lund Manchester 1994), Neary 1998, Boxer 2005, DSM-III (APA 1987), DSM-IV (APA 1994), ICD-9 (ICD-9 2006), ICD-10 (ICD-10 2010). For vascular dementia the reference standards are the NINDS-ARIEN criteria (Román 1993), DSM-III (APA 1987), DSM-IV (APA 1994), ICD-9 (ICD-9 2006) and ICD-10 (ICD-10 2010). The time interval over which progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia occurs is important. We chose one year as the minimum period of delay in the verification of the diagnosis (i.e. the time between the assessment at which a diagnosis of MCI is made and the assessment at which the diagnosis of dementia is made).","There are two target conditions in this review: 1. Alzheimer’s disease dementia (conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia); 2. Other forms of dementia (conversion from MCI to other forms of dementia, i.e. any or all of vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, or fronto-temporal dementia).","recruited and clinically classified as those with MCI at baseline were eligible for this review.

Those criteria are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1. Classification systems for describing mild cognitive impairment according to Matthews 2008 System Description Impairment Age-related cognitive change ACMI Age-consistent memory impairment Memories aging in accord with normative expectations; individual aged 50 to 79 and reports a decline in memory verified using objective memory testing performance (within ± 1 standard deviation of aged norms on 75% of tests (memory) administered); preserved general functioning.

BSF Benign senescent Forgetfulness Impairment in remote memory and intact recent memory; awareness of the impairment and use of compensatory strategies. AAMI Age-associated memory impairment Subjective and objective memory loss associated with normal aging; individual aged 50 and older and shows adequate intellectual function (i.e. without dementia). MD Minimal dementia Cognitive impairment in memory and minor and variable errors in orientation; no evidence of impaired occupational or social functioning; self care unimpaired. LCD Limited cognitive disturbance Reported decline in memory with use of compensatory strategies; occasional forgetfulness (e.g. names, places); 1 or 2 errors on cognitive (memory) testing.

Criteria for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment MCI: mild cognitive impairment Petersen 1999 Memory complaint, preferably corroborated by an informant. Impaired memory function compared for age and education. Preserved general cognitive function. Intact activities of daily living. Not demented. Petersen 2004   4 subtypes of MCI were identified: Amnesic mild cognitive impairment, single domain – isolated memory impairment of more than 1.0 SD compared with the age- and education-specific norms, and no difficulty in any other area of cognitive functioning. Amnesic mild cognitive impairment, multiple domain – 2 or more cognitive domains are impaired, 1 of which is memory impairment (impairment of more than 1.0 SD below the mean of the respective age- and education-matched population). Non-amnesic mild cognitive impairment, single domain – impairment in a single domain other than memory of more than 1.0 SD. Non-amnesic mild cognitive impairment, multiple domains – impairments in 2 or more domains of more than 1.0 SD but no memory impairment.   All 4 subtypes of mild cognitive impairment also have to meet the following criteria: a)  the presence of a complaint about memory – participants or informants (or both) reporting memory impairment. b)  intact ability to perform activities of daily living – forgetfulness not compromising overall functional ability; impairment owing to physical disease not sufficient for exclusion. c)   absence of dementia – assessed by DSM–IV criteria.   Morris 1993   Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a scale used to classify patients along a continuum from normal aging through Alzheimer’s disease. This scale describes a continuum from normal (CDR 0) through questionable dementia or MCI (CDR 0.5) to mild (CDR 1), moderate (CDR 2), and severe (CDR 3) dementia.   Patient's cognitive and functional performances are assessed in 6 areas: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Scores in each of these areas are combined to obtain the total score. We exclude those studies that involve people with MCI possibly caused by: i) current use or history of alcohol/drug abuse; ii) Central Nervous System trauma (e.g. subdural haematoma), tumour or infection; iii) other neurological conditions e.g. Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases.","We consider longitudinal cohort studies in which index test results are obtained at baseline and the reference standard results at follow-up (see below for detail about the nature of the index test and reference standard). These studies necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia and are sometimes labelled as ‘delayed verification cross-sectional studies’ (Bossuyt 2004; Bossuyt 2008; Knottnerus 2002).  We also consider case-control studies if they incorporate a delayed verification design.

CD010633,Dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies,This review had two primary objectives. Objective A: To estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (that is patients who have been referred to a specialist dementia service). Objective B: To estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB on the basis of a prior clinical work-up.,SPECT or PET imaging of brain dopamine transporters (DAT).,"This review had two primary objectives. Objective A: To estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (that is patients who have been referred to a specialist dementia service). Objective B: To estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB on the basis of a prior clinical work-up. Secondary objectives The secondary objective was to use subgroup analyses to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity. (a) Age of participants. (b) Severity of dementia. The performance of the index test itself may vary with dementia severity. For objective B, since the performance of the clinical criteria may also depend on the severity of dementia, the 'added value' to be obtained from the index test may vary significantly. (c) For objective B, diagnostic status at inclusion (possible or probable DLB, or both). (d) DAT imaging method (SPECT or PET ligand).","Neuropathological diagnosis at autopsy using contemporaneously accepted neuropathological criteria. We did not include in this review any studies in which a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB was the reference standard. There were two reasons for this: 1. Firstly, as discussed above, the accuracy―particularly the sensitivity―of the clinical criteria measured against the neuropathological reference standard is too low for them to constitute a satisfactory proxy. There is a serious possibility that the index test might outperform clinical diagnosis, rendering the latter unsuitable as a reference standard (Reitsma 2009). For some conditions, the correct clinical diagnosis may become more evident over time so that clinical diagnosis at follow-up may be a better reference standard than the cross-sectional diagnosis. (It has been used, for example, in studies of DAT imaging in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.) However, this strategy is not necessarily suitable for DLB where, as the condition progresses, symptoms converge with other types of dementia. Beyond a certain (undetermined) point, therefore, clinical diagnosis may become less discriminating with time. 2. Secondly, due to their complexity and expense, SPECT scans will probably only ever be useful as an adjunct to clinical assessment. Studies that by design cannot demonstrate an accuracy above that of careful clinical diagnosis alone have limited usefulness. A difficulty with a neuropathological reference standard (common to all diagnostic studies with delayed verification designs) is that the pathology may change between application of the index test and reference standard. In this context, the most likely scenario is that AD pathology may develop in the interim, reducing the likelihood that the initial clinical syndrome will be correctly classified as due to DLB. This may lead to a systematic bias, underestimating the specificity of the index test.","DLB, with or without co-morbid Alzheimer's disease (AD).","Objective A:  with dementia in secondary care settings. Dementia should have been diagnosed using validated clinical criteria (for example ICD, DSM). Studies that specifically excluded subjects meeting criteria for dementias other than DLB or AD (for example vascular dementia) could also be included. Objective B:  meeting clinical criteria (other than the DAT imaging criterion) for possible or probable DLB, or both. We considered this to be the most useful test of utility in clinical practice, where DAT imaging is likely to be used in addition to clinical assessment. A population meeting clinical criteria for probable DLB will already have missed many true DLB cases (because of the relatively poor sensitivity), and the opportunity for adding diagnostic value is limited (because of the already high specificity). Hence, the potential clinical utility of the test is greatest if applied to a population meeting the more sensitive but less specific criteria for possible DLB. However, participants meeting probable DLB criteria could also be included; we would examine this as a potential source of heterogeneity. We excluded participants with Parkinson's disease or other Parkinsonian syndromes known to be associated with abnormal DAT imaging.","(a) Test accuracy studies with delayed verification. (b) Diagnostic case-control studies. This applied to objective A only. These may be true case-control studies, conducted retrospectively, in which participants who underwent DAT imaging in life are included on the basis of the presence or absence of a neuropathological diagnosis of DLB at autopsy. We anticipated that a more common design would be studies in which participants were selected for inclusion on the basis of their clinically defined DLB diagnostic status. 'Cases' would meet clinical criteria (excluding the DAT imaging criterion) for probable DLB; 'controls' would not meet these criteria but would meet clinical criteria for one or more other subtypes of dementia. There is no universally agreed term for these studies, but they have been called 'two-gate designs with alternative diagnosis controls' (Rutjes 2005). These study designs were eligible for inclusion but would, if possible, be the subject of sensitivity analysis because of the risk of spectrum bias they entail.","[19759102, 19877236, 17353255, 12122169]","[19877236, 17353255, 12122169]"
CD010653,First rank symptoms for schizophrenia,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of one or multiple FRS for diagnosing schizophrenia, verified by clinical history and examination by a qualified professional (e.g. psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), with or without the use of operational criteria and checklists, in people thought to have non-organic psychotic symptoms.","Schneider First Rank Symptoms (Table 1). The presence of any one of these symptoms, or multiple symptoms, would be indicative of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We consider this an acceptable variation in threshold as Kurt Schneider proposed that presence of any one of these symptoms was diagnostic of schizophrenia as long as the person was free of other organic causes such as substance misuse, epilepsy or tumours (Schneider 1959). The different value of one symptom over another is not the focus of this review.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of one or multiple FRS for diagnosing schizophrenia, verified by clinical history and examination by a qualified professional (e.g. psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), with or without the use of operational criteria and checklists, in people thought to have non-organic psychotic symptoms.","The reference standard is history and clinical examination collected by a qualified professional (e.g., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), which may or may not involve the use of operational criteria or checklists of symptoms such as: International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 or ICD-10) (Table 2); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-III or DSM-IV) (Table 3); Feighner (Feighner 1972); Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer 1978); Carpenter criteria (Carpenter 1973); New Haven (Astrachan 1974); Taylor Abrams (Taylor 1978); Bleulerian (Bleuler 1950) and/or ego function (Bellak 1973). The more modern of these criteria involve some degree of follow-up. Ideally, in order to avoid incorporation bias the reference standard and the diagnostic test under consideration should be entirely independent of one another (Worster 2008). We were not be able to avoid incorporation bias with this review, as in most cases the reference standard incorporated FRS and hence the diagnostic accuracy may potentially be overestimated (Worster 2008). Also, in many cases using FRS also included taking a history and clinical examination, again contaminating the uniqueness of either approach. Differences between FRS and the reference standard lies in utilisation of: a longitudinal frame work in addition to the cross sectional assessment of specific symptoms of psychosis such as FRS (reflecting limbic system abnormalities); and less specific symptoms of psychosis such as the consequences of having acute psychotic symptoms and the deleterious effects of psychosis. Heterogeneity due to whether FRSs or any operational criteria were used as part of the reference standard was investigated.","All types of schizophrenia disorder regardless of descriptive subcategory (e.g. paranoid, disorganised, catatonic, undifferentiated and residual). Studies that reported results combined for diagnoses related to schizophrenia (e.g. schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorder) in which data could not be separated were included and we investigated potential heterogeneity.","We included adolescents and adults presenting with psychotic symptoms, which included symptoms such as, hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking and speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour, or negative symptoms (i.e. affective flattening, alogia, or volition). We did not exclude on the grounds of co-morbidities. In addition, if a study reported all admissions to a psychiatric ward instead of only people admitted with psychosis, the study, including those participants with non-psychotic symptoms, was not excluded. We did exclude if participants had organic source of psychosis, such as that triggered by an existent physical disease or alcohol and drug abuse. Particular attention was paid to history, current clinical state (acute, post-acute or quiescent), stage of illness (prodromal, early, established, late), or if there were predominant clinical issues (negative or positive symptoms). In addition, setting and referral status of people in the study was noted. We recognise that people in psychiatric hospital have already experienced a considerable degree of prior testing compared with those in community settings. Also, for similar reasons, people referred to a specialist centre treating only those with schizophrenia may well be different to those in general care.","We included both retrospective and prospective studies, which consecutively or randomly selected participants.

Secondary objectives We planned to investigate heterogeneity in relation to the reference standard (culture-based DST compared with (1) genetic sequencing, (2) culture-based DST and genetic sequencing, and (3) culture-based DST followed by genetic sequencing with discordant results) and individual drugs within a drug class (for example, ofloxacin and moxifloxacin within the FQ class). We also pre-specified in the protocol investigations of heterogeneity in relation to HIV status, condition of the specimens (fresh or frozen, volume of specimen), patient population (patients suspected of having MDR-TB or XDR-TB) and whether WHO-recommended critical drug concentrations were used for culture-based reference testing.","The following reference standards were used to define the target conditions: Phenotypic culture-based DST: solid culture or a commercial liquid culture system (BACTEC 460, MGIT 960 and MGIT Manual System, Becton Dickinson, USA) incorporating the drug of interest. Genetic sequencing of the gyrA or rrs genes, or both. Two reference standards used together: phenotypic culture-based DST and genetic sequencing of the same samples. If a specimen was resistant according to phenotypic culture-based DST or had a mutation in the gyrA or rrs genes, the specimen was classified as having the target condition. If both phenotypic culture-based DST and genetic sequencing indicated susceptibility, the specimen was classified as not having the target condition. Two reference standards used sequentially: phenotypic culture-based DST followed by selective testing by genetic sequencing of samples with discordant results (also referred to as discrepant analysis). Discordant results may be either index test positive/phenotypic culture-based DST negative or index test negative/phenotypic culture-based DST positive. There are strengths and limitations to each of the reference standards. As mentioned, phenotypic culture-based DST is the conventional reference standard, but it is considered to be imperfect and is dependent on the drug concentration threshold used to define resistance. Genetic sequencing is considered to be more accurate than phenotypic culture-based DST; however, this is only if it targets all known resistance determining regions, which are not completely defined for the FQs and the SLIDs. Therefore, genetic sequencing can miss mutations that may cause drug resistance which fall outside of the targeted genes. Furthermore, genetic sequencing is usually applied only to culture isolates when results for the index test and the culture-based reference test do not agree. In this latter situation, there is potential for verification bias because the same reference standard is not being used to verify all index test results. We carried out separate analyses for the different reference standards, described below. In our primary analysis we used culture-based DST as the reference standard. We expected all or nearly all included studies to report results using this reference standard.","We considered three target conditions: Resistance to any of the FQs. The FQs include ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. We excluded ciprofloxacin because this drug is infrequently used in DST. Resistance to any of the SLIDs. The SLIDs include two aminoglycosides, kanamycin and amikacin, and one cyclic peptide, capreomycin. XDR-TB. For the FQs, the presence of mutations in each of the genes probed by the MTBDRsl assay has very high concordance with resistance to all drugs within that drug class. For example, a mutation in the gyrA usually means a strain is resistant to each of the FQs: ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (Sirgel 2012a). The same holds true for the rrs gene and the two aminoglycosides, kanamycin and amikacin (Sirgel 2012b). Evidence is mixed regarding the level of concordance between resistance to the two aminoglycosides and capreomycin arising from mutations in the rrs gene. We acknowledge that determining resistance to all three SLIDs together, and thus including capreomycin with the aminoglycosides, may be a limitation. However, the index test results are reported in this manner.

The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment. Secondary objectives To investigate the following as potential sources of heterogeneity: age, sex, previous PE, prolonged immobilisation and type of reference standard. We recognise that all of these listed items except type of reference standard are patient-specific rather than study-specific, and we anticipate that study reports may lack the necessary level of detail to enable an informative analysis.","We included studies that used various reference standards (RS) encompassing pulmonary angiography, V/Q scintigraphy, CTPA and MRPA.

When the data were available, we intended to group patients according to whether or not they received anticoagulant treatment, the specific CPR and the D-dimer assay, as these are not standardised (Schreiber 2002). Patients with indeterminate or conflicting test results may undergo repeat imaging; the most commonly used imaging test for this is CTPA or V/Q scanning, but eligibility criteria of the review specify inclusion only of studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the initial D-dimer test.

CD011053,Imaging for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTPA, lung scintigraphy and MRA for the diagnosis of PE during pregnancy. and to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in relation to the reference standard of pulmonary angiography or clinical follow-up for at least six weeks for occurrence of symptomatic PE.","Studies investigating CTPA, lung scintigraphy, either planar or V/Q SPECT and either with or without ventilation scanning, and MRA as an index test were eligible for inclusion. If the patient had undergone the same index test more than once, we included only data on the first index test performed. If the first test was followed by a different index test, we included this test result. Data on original assessments of the index test result in the clinical setting were preferred over re-assessments for study purposes.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTPA, lung scintigraphy and MRA for the diagnosis of PE during pregnancy. and to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in relation to the reference standard of pulmonary angiography or clinical follow-up for at least six weeks for occurrence of symptomatic PE. Secondary objectives To determine the number of inconclusive test results for each diagnostic test or diagnostic strategy, defined as neither showing nor excluding PE. We aimed to investigate the effects of following clinical factors on the negative predictive value of index tests. 1. Prior testing (e.g. using clinical decision rule results and D-dimer testing). 2. Gestational age. 3. Type of reference standard. 4. Technological advances of CTPA (multi-slice vs single-slice).","We accepted as reference standards both pulmonary angiography and clinical follow-up for the occurrence of symptomatic PE for at least six weeks. We anticipated that few or no studies would use pulmonary angiography as the reference standard. We considered a PE confirmed within three months of the index test as a positive reference test. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed on pulmonary angiography in the case of a new intraluminal filling defect, with cut-off of contrast material in a vessel with diameter greater than 2.5 mm. If clinical follow-up was applied as the reference standard, objective diagnostic testing had to be performed in the case of symptoms of PE. Objective criteria for the diagnosis of PE included a (new) intraluminal filling defect on CTPA; cut-off of contrast material in a vessel greater than 2.5 mm in diameter; a new perfusion defect involving at least 75% of a segment, with corresponding normal ventilation (i.e. a high-probability lung scan); a new non-diagnostic lung scan accompanied by documentation of DVT on ultrasonography or venography; and confirmation of a new PE at autopsy. For clinical follow-up, PE was also diagnosed when symptoms of PE were combined with a diagnosis of DVT. The objective criterion for the diagnosis of DVT was a (new) non-compressible venous segment or a substantial increase (4 mm or more) in the diameter of the thrombus during full compression in a previously abnormal segment on ultrasonography, or a new intraluminal filling defect on venography. In case of an inconclusive index test, we considered the reference test positive if the patient was treated on clinical grounds without objective evidence of VTE on follow-up. This provides a conservative estimate of both negative predictive value and sensitivity in the primary analysis. When both pulmonary angiography and clinical follow-up were performed, we considered pulmonary angiography the reference standard.","The target condition of this review is symptomatic PE. For studies that provided multiple definitions of non-diagnostic scans according to the level of the pulmonary vasculature, we considered scans as non-diagnostic when they were of insufficient quality to allow visualisation of PE at segmental or more proximal levels.","Participants were pregnant women with clinical suspicion of PE. Conditions for suspicion of PE and confirmation of pregnancy were left to the discretion of the authors of included studies. We did not include data on postpartum or asymptomatic patients. If not all women in the study met the inclusion criteria of the present review, data had to be extractable for relevant participants. If relevant data were not extractable and could not be supplied by the study author, we excluded the study. Study populations from secondary and tertiary care settings, comprising inpatients and outpatients, were eligible for inclusion. We excluded primary care patients because test accuracy can vary with care setting.","We considered studies with a prospective or retrospective consecutive patient series design eligible for inclusion. The minimum sample size was set at 25 per index test, in light of the a priori chance of PE of 4%; we deemed smaller studies uninformative. Studies could still be included if patients received one of multiple index tests and the choice between tests was not random and was not based on a clear protocol, as long as recruitment was consecutive. We considered inclusion consecutive if study authors described it using this or similar terms. The quality item on consecutive inclusion could still be scored 'no' on the basis of criteria provided in Table 1 (see below). In studies in which the index test could be performed multiple times for one patient, study authors reported the index test result on a patient or scan basis. In both cases, data on index test results in relation to reference results had to be extractable from the article or provided on request by study authors. We excluded case-control studies. Table 1. QUADAS-2 checklist CTPA: computed tomography pulmonary angiography. CUS: compression ultrasonography. DVT: deep vein thrombosis. PA: pulmonary angiography. PE: pulmonary embolism.   Item plus signalling questions Criteria for scoring 'yes', 'no' and 'unclear' 1 PATIENT SELECTION Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? Was a case-control design avoided? Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? We will score this item 'yes' when patients were consecutively or randomly selected; 90% or more were evaluated at the hospital; 5% or less of had received anticoagulant therapy within 24 hours before testing; 30% or less were given a diagnosis of comorbidity such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other pulmonary disease, malignancy or pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets or eclampsia); and 10% or less had undergone prior testing for this episode of suspected PE. We will score 'no' if one of these criteria was not met. 2 INDEX TEST Were index test results interpreted without knowledge of results of the reference standard? We will score this item 'yes' in the following cases: if study authors state that the index test interpreter was unaware of the result of the reference test; or if the order of testing was index test before reference test for every patient. Even if clinical follow-up was the reference test, the order of testing has to be stated for the item to be scored 'yes'. We will score the item ‘no’ for studies in which it is stated that the interpreter of the index test was aware of the result of the reference test. In other cases, we will score this as 'unclear'. In cases of studies directly comparing the diagnostic accuracy of 2 index tests against the reference standard, these test results had to be interpreted without knowledge of the results of the comparator index test, and we will score this item similarly to the approach described above. 3 REFERENCE STANDARD Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? Were reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test? We considered both PA and clinical follow-up of at least 6 weeks as useful for correct classification of the target condition, the latter only if objective diagnostic tests are used in cases of suspected venous thromboembolism. We will score this item 'yes' if study authors state that reference tests were interpreted without knowledge of results of the index test. Furthermore, in cases of clinical follow-up as a reference standard, any clinical suspicion of venous thrombosis during follow-up needs to be followed by objective diagnostic testing (i.e. CUS or venography for suspicion of DVT, and scintigraphy, CTPA or pulmonary angiography for clinical suspicion of PE). If a patient died during follow-up, we classified death as caused by PE in cases of confirmation by autopsy, in cases of an objective test positive for PE before death or if PE could not be confidently excluded as the cause of death. 4 FLOW AND TIMING Was an appropriate interval between index test(s) and reference standard provided? Did all patients receive a reference standard? Did all patients receive the same reference standard? Were all patients included in the analysis? With PA, we will consider a time period of less than 24 hours between index and reference tests as short enough to ensure that the target condition did not change between tests, either because of natural progression of the disease or because of therapeutic intervention. For studies using pulmonary angiography as the reference test, we will score this item 'yes' if the time between index and reference tests was less than 24 hours. Similarly, for studies directly comparing diagnostic accuracy of index tests, we will consider a time period of less than 24 hours between index tests and the reference test as short enough. During clinical follow-up, the disease may diminish through natural progression or through intervention. Or the condition may arise during follow-up if it was not present at the time of the index test. Therefore, we will score studies using clinical follow-up 'no' for this item. We will score this item 'no' if less than 90% or a non-random selection of patients underwent the reference test. We will score this item 'no' if less than 90% of patients who had an index test result underwent pulmonary angiography or had clinical follow-up as the reference test.","[24434350, 12020189, 19546768, 19940668, 9166067, 24370129, 22006654, 19843734, 17342484, 22021496, 21131583, 23534587, 20729418, 25916742]","[24434350, 12020189, 19940668, 24370129, 22006654, 19843734, 17342484, 20729418, 25916742]"

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) compared with 2D SIS according to type of abnormality and discrimination between uterine polyps and submucous fibroids in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy and histology used as the reference.","Diagnostic hysteroscopy was the reference standard for confirmation of the absence or presence of the target condition. Absence of an intracavitary abnormality was seen as clear vision of the entire cavity without disruption of the endometrial lining. When reported, we also used histology as a reference standard to differentiate the type of abnormality (polyp or fibroid). Because the sensitivity for 2D SIS is known to be high (de Kroon 2003), it might be considered unethical to perform hysteroscopy in women with a negative SIS test (meaning no suspicion of abnormality). To optimise data quantity, we included data from studies with partial verification bias (i.e. when some women did not undergo a hysteroscopy (reference standard) after a negative test result with 2D SIS).","The target condition was the presence (or absence) of a focally growing lesion in the uterine cavity (endometrial polyp, submucous fibroid). We differentiated between polyps and fibroids by classifying smoothly margined echogenic masses with a homogenous texture as polyps (Parsons 1993), and well-defined round lesions within the myometrium or attached to it, often showing shadows at the edge of the lesion and/or internal fan-shaped shadowing, as uterine fibroids (van den Bosch 2015a). Typically, echogenicity varies and some hyperechogenicity may be present internally. We classified submucous fibroids into types of fibroid (types 0 to 2) using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) PALM-COEIN classification for abnormal uterine bleeding: type 0 = pedunculated intracavitary, 1 = submucosal < 50% intramural, 2 = submucosal ≥ 50% intramural (Munro 2011).

We had hoped to compare the results of using these different reference standards in a sensitivity analysis. However, the majority of studies (73%) reported a composite reference standard, including more than one of the three reference standards listed above, as part of a prespecified clinical pathway and so the specific reference standard applied varied between participants within the same study.

CD011420,Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay for detecting active tuberculosis in HIV-positive adults,To assess the accuracy of lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LF-LAM) for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in HIV-positive adults who have signs and symptoms suggestive of TB.To assess the accuracy of the LF-LAM as a screening test for active TB disease in HIV-positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms suggestive of TB.,"The index test was Alere DetermineTM TB LAM Ag test (LF-LAM, Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), the only commercial lateral flow urine LAM assay available as of December 2015. We evaluated the test at two different cut-off values for positivity (grade 1 and grade 2) based on the original manufacturer reference card. Grade 2 (corresponding to grade 1 on the new manufacturer reference card) is the currently recommended threshold for positivity.","Primary objectives To assess the accuracy of lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LF-LAM) for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in HIV-positive adults who have signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. To assess the accuracy of the LF-LAM as a screening test for active TB disease in HIV-positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. Secondary objectives To compare the diagnostic accuracy of LF-LAM and existing tests, sputum smear microscopy or sputum Xpert® MTB/RIF, as well as determine the diagnostic accuracy of LF-LAM when added to existing tests. To investigate heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies. Possible sources of heterogeneity include CD4 count and clinical setting (inpatient versus outpatient setting).","We required studies to diagnose TB using at least one of the following two reference standards. Microbiological reference standard: we defined 'TB' as a positive M. tuberculosis culture or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); we defined 'not TB' as a negative M. tuberculosis culture and NAAT (if performed). Composite reference standard that included M. tuberculosis culture together with at least one of the following components: NAAT, smear, or clinical findings: we defined 'TB' as (1) a positive culture, or (2) a positive NAAT, or (3) a positive smear, or (4) a clinical decision to start TB treatment, and, after at least one month of follow-up, the participant was diagnosed as having TB; we defined 'not TB' as a negative culture and NAAT (if performed), no TB treatment given, and resolution of signs and symptoms at follow-up. NAATs included: Enhanced Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test (E-MTD, Gen-Probe, San Diego, USA); Amplicor Mycobacterium tuberculosis Test (Amplicor, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland); COBAS® TaqMan® MTB Test (Roche Diagnostics); GenoType MTBDRplus (HAIN Lifescieces, Nehren, Germany); and Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA). For a microbiological reference standard, we considered a higher quality reference standard to be one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for TB diagnosis and a lower quality reference standard to be one in which only one specimen type was evaluated for TB diagnosis. For a composite reference standard, we did not require all components to be provided on all participants. Of note, we excluded sputum smear from a composite reference standard and sputum Xpert® MTB/RIF from both a microbiological and a composite reference standard for the purpose of performing analyses of LF-LAM in combination with either sputum smear or sputum Xpert® MTB/RIF. We excluded participants as 'unclassifiable' if we could not classify them as either 'TB' or 'not TB' based on these reference standard definitions. We consider that there are strengths and limitations to each reference standard. A microbiological reference standard, primarily culture, is considered the best reference standard. We expected all studies to obtain sputum specimens and some studies to obtain additional specimens for culture. However, the primary concern with relying on sputum culture alone is that people with TB disease may be missed for the following reasons: HIV-positive people may not be able to provide sputum specimens of sufficient quality; sputum bacillary load is typically low in people living with HIV; and a substantial proportion of people with HIV-associated TB cannot produce sputum at all (Lawn 2013a) or have extrapulmonary TB without pulmonary TB. This means that index test TPs may be misclassified as FPs by sputum culture. Therefore, when evaluating LF-LAM with respect to sputum culture, the number of FPs (classified as positive by the index test and negative by the reference test) may be increased and LF-LAM specificity may be underestimated (Lawn 2015). This misclassification may also lead to underestimation of sensitivity. Increasing the sensitivity of the reference standard by evaluating multiple specimens, including evaluating specimens from sites of disease for extrapulmonary TB, may reduce the number of cases of TB disease incorrectly classified as 'not TB' by culture. In contrast, a composite reference standard that includes microbiological or clinical components may correctly classify index test results as TPs (instead of as FPs with respect to culture), especially in people with paucibacillary disease in whom culture may be negative. However, because of the uncertainties that surround a clinical diagnosis of TB, a reference standard that uses clinical TB (in culture-negative people) is considered a lower quality reference standard and may incorrectly classify people without TB as having TB.","The target condition was active TB disease, which includes pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.","Participants were adults (15 years and older is considered 'adult' for purpose of TB surveillance) and who were HIV positive. We included participants in whom there was a suspicion of TB based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with TB, as well as participants who may or may not have had signs and symptoms compatible with TB and had not been previously evaluated for TB. Signs and symptoms of TB include cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats.","We included primary studies that evaluated the accuracy of LF-LAM for diagnosis of or screening for active TB in people living with HIV and compared the index test with a defined reference standard. We also included studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of one of the alternative tests (sputum microscopy or sputum Xpert® MTB/RIF) in addition to LF-LAM.

Due to resource constraints, we also excluded studies if the report did not present enough information to allow full assessment of eligibility or if the study was reported only in a non-English language.","[20979601, 17148078, 17291898, 20218482, 21978238, 15361993, 12950138, 12791849, 11225143, 10583325, 11781267, 22514617, 8980591, 12174773, 12174772, 21860139, 23902626, 11061627, 19187517, 17244413, 23791385, 11398670, 1761684, 11262857, 16027061, 9988333, 10983554, 9582585, 19863789, 23234579, 12387772, 16048034, 19527797, 12712759, 18202438, 15767635, 15969747, 15275520, 21087378, 16483425, 18038150, 21461266, 19271402, 22198787, 12214515, 12563774, 18598344, 19413207, 12689544, 23294729, 18160449, 10561760, 19482001, 18513771, 19682968, 23758950, 11500771, 12587607, 18320124, 18441999, 22770130, 7516807, 11773110, 15007639, 23024493, 15591666, 16603648, 12572958, 18620560, 12055782, 16711337, 9231194, 19478249, 18524335, 21796913, 23608372, 11582872, 11358000, 15365017, 11003728, 17172395, 16931409, 19222821, 9125830, 8266395, 10405377, 8665389, 22182735, 16124417, 22054069, 19635896, 9612775, 12219143, 19362256, 7856824, 20005196, 22720788, 8653815, 17401497, 21703009, 18298604, 17556616, 8944258, 24086328, 20025183, 18053347, 18240951, 9861398, 23041541, 16259289, 21951996, 18256418, 23569920, 21922236, 18297164, 10999091, 17362594, 19846265, 21880972, 16492359, 11123823, 23085326, 17034070, 20378137, 20065011, 20065013, 9439488, 21435256, 17006296, 17486264, 19765788, 10511977, 2446789, 11487366, 12596367, 22047131, 10072131, 16124416, 11957314, 17175704, 16505556, 18951743, 22032415, 11251904, 12516921, 9986839, 11693975, 11904103, 10489737, 21122128, 19519915, 18031779, 17135432, 21700669, 17367480, 20529273, 20003328, 19860920, 18165483, 15000726, 22443344, 22302848, 9279979, 22302847, 22302846, 11952945, 9764322, 15490787, 9754317, 10444320, 18680960, 11425156, 10948029, 11388505, 22929630, 14605156, 12243234, 23472135, 10232784, 9444000, 15255320, 19399156, 12436172, 9692144, 9692145, 17291976, 12409392, 15655012, 10696408, 10072132, 11191436, 12139227, 14516298, 11205592, 17040820, 9929032, 22647557, 17543127, 15701557, 2202221, 16530797, 15461206, 10699018, 12287805, 12662417, 23941281, 9373632, 9373633, 9373631, 12206045, 18976561, 18711803, 1995939, 10444878, 16981647, 17360871, 11380433, 11989528, 19930666, 7570824, 10884866, 23345297, 12461593, 9509174, 9886191, 21932547, 10897358, 12632146, 17962153, 15155979, 14740873, 21444989, 17506881, 15066340, 16282293, 11388507, 15228812, 20046181, 24172045, 10900922, 23742633, 11132380, 17337962, 10928351, 15821800, 20602766, 10862317, 9236821, 20642834, 9002372, 16014858, 17605054, 11728042, 14996360, 18626455, 19272157, 19019399, 20046179, 12567635, 9063360, 10734522, 12454146, 15272742, 11700187, 17206113, 18541764, 16192446, 15638301, 10203469, 14766829, 14510166, 11398664, 22438699, 21749585, 15310018, 16553923, 18383801, 19564967, 10715695, 18163135, 10497842, 12971557, 23508787, 18959777, 8758063, 11716121, 11716120, 15549388, 19173772, 9509627, 18983278, 20646312, 23683333, 7906328, 22144432, 14655635, 19019233, 20554822, 19399160, 19948018, 23692957, 20003199, 20973878, 15904775, 21605401, 12812358, 19270300, 11293505, 24652214, 23663437, 18834523, 18166801, 18827859, 23667710, 9080879, 18784232, 8846490, 12164291, 22818643, 10463010, 18793410, 18719728, 19735557, 23587371, 23577630, 15452770, 16117960, 23249688, 18981501, 9797836, 20003378, 12454171, 9656392, 22114867, 15552593, 16548497, 12791059, 10929047, 14552743, 23016476, 3041624, 19479634, 19508434, 11474008, 21676264, 17713633, 16216106, 23493003, 9431947, 10746389, 16859025, 20028563, 9227798, 19930609, 11427610, 15728862, 10339800, 22898068, 18156732, 11423356, 15217738, 19950541, 12792694, 27365600, 11411942, 18218394, 10492756, 9017909, 21696587, 19996417, 22929537, 20207689, 17259188, 19407111, 12518844, 23805822, 23822515, 17300631, 11230422, 18853608, 14708867, 23731660, 12061980, 18799699, 24409647, 10748901, 10748900, 23721276, 19836683, 21703016, 19686072, 22536317, 12224568, 16813240, 21376357, 27407801, 16862709, 16943212, 10546844, 8940977, 17919672, 17642705, 12078230, 1406728, 11532200, 15916076, 19416497, 10492788, 18498626, 11755428, 12932092, 9769889, 18589463]","[20979601, 23234579, 23294729, 19482001, 7516807, 18620560, 16711337, 17172395, 10405377, 20005196, 21703009, 24086328, 18256418, 11123823, 11693975, 20529273, 15000726, 15255320, 12662417, 17360871, 15228812, 24172045, 23742633, 20602766, 20046179, 23692957, 22818643, 16117960, 18981501, 18218394, 22536317, 21376357, 17642705, 12932092]"

Secondary objectives We planned to explore the following sources of heterogeneity. Studies at low risk of bias versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool, recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group) (Whiting 2006; Whiting 2011). Full text publications versus abstracts (this can give a clue about publication bias since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication status) (Eloubeidi 2001). Prospective studies versus retrospective studies. Proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer, ampullary cancer, and duodenal cancers (although classified as periampullary cancers they each have a different prognosis) (Klempnauer 1995). The additional value of the imaging modalities may be different because of the extent of spread in these different types of periampullary cancers. Different definitions for resectable cancer on laparotomy. Different surgeons may consider cancer unresectable differently i.e. different surgeons would have different criteria for unresectability on laparotomy (other than the consensus criteria for resectability). For example, one surgeon may judge that the cancer is unresectable on laparotomy because of the involvement of the local vessels (mainly portal vein and superior mesenteric vein) and consider the reference standard to be positive. This would result in a false negative result for the imaging modality. Another surgeon may judge the same cancer to be resectable despite the involvement of the vessel and proceed with resection. The reference standard would be negative in this situation, which would result in a true negative result for the imaging modality. This might have an intrinsic threshold effect. Additional pre-tests performed (besides CT scan). This can alter the pre-test probability of unresectability and can help in the assessment of the additional value of the imaging modality under various situations.","Confirmation of liver, peritoneal, or nodal metastatic involvement by histopathological examination of suspicious (liver, peritoneal, or nodal metastatic) lesions obtained at diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy. We accepted only paraffin section histology as the reference standard. In clinical practice, depending on the urgency of the results, a frozen section biopsy may be done to obtain immediate results. However, this is always confirmed by subsequent paraffin section histology (which can take several days) because frozen section biopsy is not as reliable as paraffin section histology. We also accepted the surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy when biopsy confirmation was not possible as an alternate reference standard. For example, if the tumour has invaded the adjacent blood vessels the surgeon may not resect the tumour because of the danger posed by resecting part of a large blood vessel, and so biopsy confirmation cannot be obtained. However, it should be noted that a surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy is a subjective decision and is a possible source of error in the reference standard. In the absence of an ethical and true gold standard, we accepted this as a reference standard.","The target conditions were unresectable pancreatic and periampullary cancers, that is, we considered the imaging modality a positive test if the pancreatic or periampullary cancer is unresectable with curative intent. In these cancers it is not possible to perform curative resectability. Clinically, it may not be easy to distinguish head of pancreas cancers, ampullary cancers, and cancer of the second part of the duodenum. The treatment for these different cancers is the same, i.e. pancreatoduodenectomy and the final confirmation as to the origin of these cancers may be done after resection without definitive diagnosis of the origin of the cancer, as long as the cancers are resectable. So we considered these cancers together. There are no uniform criteria for resectability of pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Consensus exists for the definition of borderline resectable cancers (Abrams 2009). Therefore, where there is less tissue involvement than in a borderline resectable cancer the tumour can be considered as resectable. We accepted any criteria of resectability used by the study authors and acknowledge that this could potentially create a threshold effect. In general, the cancer will not be resected if liver, peritoneal, or distal nodal metastases were noted, or if the cancer had invaded important adjacent blood vessels that are beyond the criteria for borderline resectable cancers (for example, greater than 180° involvement of the superior mesenteric artery) (Abrams 2009).","Adults considered for curative resection of pancreatic or periampullary cancer on the basis of CT findings, who were fit to undergo major surgery. We included patients in this review irrespective of whether they underwent other imaging modalities prior to imaging modality being assessed.","We only included studies that provided diagnostic test accuracy data (true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative) on the different imaging modalities mentioned above in the appropriate patient population (see below) irrespective of language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. However, we excluded case reports which do not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data. We also planned to exclude any identified case-control studies because case-control studies are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).","[10385719, 22134196, 12120243, 10210345, 18330088, 10968852, 9691893, 18788630, 11004329, 9882912, 21499211, 22510123, 16041214, 20925260, 19523619, 12185052, 15532836, 16264878, 26710694, 20443074, 18568138, 9040998, 18942637, 10025831, 11813616, 24650967, 9324129, 25916136, 16845288, 1633770, 17152491, 11023562, 11023561, 22460727, 15968734, 25327670, 8781948, 14580100, 8778925, 12661230, 17347637, 22000199, 10482707, 22699206, 11023593, 22699202, 25043494, 3049060, 23465982, 8979062, 18953833, 20205504, 25795439, 12647407, 19711405, 19080491, 1795424, 22184371, 18726967, 11587685, 8600960, 17440790, 17403279, 11020897, 8942546, 10565771, 9510578, 21693662, 15929774, 25780297, 17344007, 24331185, 18836619, 16633011, 9442123, 26053713, 16265180, 17594541, 11335098, 25293823, 8491131, 8491130, 23717744, 19476136, 10399976, 15497081, 25929273, 10950037, 14527907, 21436084, 15933686, 25625104, 15973224, 25722999, 20495653, 11154172, 1727753, 16119317, 18551347, 9202539, 9165320, 11424095, 7090849, 18703604, 14872379, 9051012, 8491138, 8819400, 11787375, 16141999, 22155849, 1559451, 16548195, 18332991, 9351708, 20142748, 2154172, 20467829, 24928186, 22996048, 19173910, 15545675, 11174289, 8960077, 18176963, 8453927, 15838173, 22559838, 21985852, 24762501, 15114028, 10570337, 24721105, 10429702, 8781933, 8571901, 12091659, 11568348, 15230749, 7724748, 2183284, 9166560, 20339309, 20563868, 23504604, 8056236, 15056091, 7560319, 18396644, 9280938, 18942059, 12434099, 19070981, 3535030, 11007225, 11914153, 8535622, 10931589, 11870425, 25616755]","[11154172, 18332991]"

Such studies were excluded Yes: all patients meeting the selection criteria (selected patients) were included in the analysis, or data on all the selected patients were available so that a 2 x 2 table including all selected patients could be constructed No: not all patients meeting the selection criteria were included in the analysis or the 2 x 2 table could not be constructed using data on all selected patients Unclear: this was not clear from the report Low risk: 'yes' for all signalling questions High risk: 'no' or 'unclear' for at least one signalling question   Full text publications versus abstracts (this may indicate publication bias if there is an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication) (Eloubeidi 2001). Prospective versus retrospective studies. Symptomatic versus asymptomatic common bile duct stones (the presence of symptoms may increase the pre-test probability). Symptomatic patients are defined as patients showing upper right quadrant abdominal pain, jaundice, acute cholangitis or acute pancreatitis (Anciaux 1986; Roston 1997; Raraty 1998; Toh 2000; Tranter 2003). Prevalence of common bile duct stones in each included study. The prevalence of common bile duct stones in the population analysed by each included study may vary and cause heterogeneity. Prevalence may also change with the presence of patients with comorbidities that would predispose them to common bile duct stones such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, Caroli's disease, hypercholesterolaemia, sickle cell anaemia, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Proportion of patients with previous cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy may cause dilatation of the common bile duct (Benjaminov 2013) and subsequently change the accuracy of the index test, particularly imaging modalities. Proportion of patients with common bile duct strictures (only for index tests that use contrast material, as strictures may prevent contrast material from filling the common bile duct completely and, therefore, change the accuracy of the index test).","We accepted the following reference standards. For test positives, we accepted confirmation of a common bile duct stone by extraction of the stone (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods). For test negatives, we acknowledged that there was no way of being absolutely sure that there were no common bile duct stones. However, we accepted negative results by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months as the reference standard. Surgical or endoscopic exploration is adequate but it is not commonly used in patients with negative index tests because of its invasive nature. Therefore, we accepted follow-up as a less adequate reference test. Negative exploration of the common bile duct is likely to be a better reference standard than follow-up for at least six months since most stones already present in the common bile duct are likely to be identified and extracted in this fashion. Six months is an arbitrary choice but we anticipated that most common bile duct stones will manifest during this period.",Common bile duct stones.,Patients at risk or suspected of having common bile duct stones with or without prior diagnosis of cholelithiasis; with or without symptoms and complications of common bile duct stones or with or without prior treatment for common bile duct stones; and before or after cholecystectomy.,"We included studies providing cross-sectional information comparing one or more of the index tests against a reference standard in the appropriate patient population (see Participants). We included studies irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We planned to include comparative studies in which EUS and MRCP were performed in the same study population, either by giving all patients both index tests or by randomly allocating patients to receive MRCP or EUS. We planned to exclude diagnostic case-control studies if there were at least four cross-sectional or comparative studies.",[17521400],[17521400]
CD011602,Ultrasonography for diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease,To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for detecting the presence or absence of cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease compared with liver biopsy as reference standard.,"Ultrasonography in any mode. As we expected that study authors would have used different measurements, signs, and combinations of signs for assessment of cirrhosis by ultrasonography with different techniques and mode, we did not specify these here in advance. However, we considered parenchymal, vascular, and extrahepatic ultrasonographic signs as different index tests.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for detecting the presence or absence of cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease compared with liver biopsy as reference standard. Secondary objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of any of the ultrasonography tests, B-mode or Echo-colour Doppler ultrasonography, used singly or combined, or plus ultrasonography signs, or a combination of these, for detecting hepatic cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease compared with liver biopsy as a reference standard, irrespective of sequence. In case of discrepancies in the results, we planned to explore heterogeneity analysing: liver biopsy as the reference standard: different grade of inflammation (amount of ongoing inflammation and necrosis) according to the liver biopsy (below two grades compared to two or greater grades of activity); different lengths of liver biopsy sample (shorter than 15 mm compared to 15 mm or longer) or number of portal tracts (fewer than six compared to six or more), as reported in the studies; percutaneous liver biopsy versus transvenous (transjugular) liver biopsy versus laparoscopic liver biopsy; different technical characteristics of the ultrasonography equipment (e.g., different transducers, different wave lengths); different skills of the operator as stated by the authors; complete abstinent (teetotalers) or non-abstinent study participants (as defined in the included studies). In addition, we attempted to identify the most accurate ultrasonographic tests and indices for diagnosis of cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease.","Liver biopsy. Liver biopsy could have been obtained by percutaneous needle techniques with needles 1.4 to 1.6 mm (16 to 18 gauge) in diameter, transjugular method, or surgical specimens including laparoscopy (Kuntz 2008; Ivashkin 2011b). Liver biopsy is the only existing reference standard for diagnosing hepatic cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease. Specimens of liver tissue with a length of at least 15 mm and at least six portal tracts are among the factors that can provide reliable morphological diagnosis of cirrhosis (Bedossa 2003; Colloredo 2003; Rockey 2009). If liver biopsy samples were reported with any of the semi-quantitative scores, that is, METAVIR (Michalak 2003), Knodell (Franciscus 2007), Ishak (Franciscus 2007), Kleiner (Kleiner 2005), Scheuer (Regev 2002), Brunt (Brunt 1999), or Batts-Ludwig (Haque 2010), we planned to use a conversion grid for hepatic fibrosis staging adapted after Goodman 2007 to only unify results for hepatic cirrhosis on liver biopsy (Table 1). METAVIR has already been validated for staging alcoholic cirrhosis (Michalak 2003).","There are five stages of liver fibrosis by METAVIR (Table 1): F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = mild fibrosis; F2 = significant fibrosis; F3 = severe fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis. The target condition is the presence of cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease, defined using the METAVIR score. Thus, we dichotomised the fibrosis estimated by the METAVIR score as follows: we considered people with a METAVIR score of F4 as 'diseased' and people with a METAVIR score of F0 plus F1 plus F2 plus F3 as 'non-diseased'.","Participants of any sex and ethnic origin, over 16 years old, and diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease, following study authors' statements. The participants could have been hospitalised or managed as outpatients. The diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease in the study participants should have been established based on registered history of excessive alcohol intake of sufficient duration and quantity together with clinical evidence of liver disease expressed with physical signs at examination and followed by laboratory evidence of liver disease. To ascertain the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease and study the presence or absence of cirrhosis, both ultrasonography and liver biopsy should have been performed, irrespective of the sequence. We planned to also include participants if suspected of having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in addition to diagnosed alcoholic liver disease. We did not consider for inclusion people diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease and having a concomitant liver disease such as chronic hepatitis C virus infection, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, autoimmune liver disease, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We extracted data on study participants with alcoholic liver disease alone whenever such data were available in the study report or whenever we could obtain the data required for the review through personal communication with study authors. In the latter case, we disregarded some of the data presented in the publication and used the data provided by the study authors through personal communication.","Diagnostic cohort study designs and diagnostic case-control study designs that assessed alcoholic cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease through ultrasonography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We planned to include randomised clinical trials or controlled clinical studies had they fulfilled the inclusion criteria of our review protocol. We included studies published as full paper articles, in the form of abstracts published in conference proceedings, or presented as posters if any of these were identified with the searches. We also considered studies if they had included participants with different aetiologies of liver disease.","[1999069, 22473911, 10190731, 24459644, 9453422, 12601199, 3080046, 1544561]",[24459644]
CD011686,Triage tools for detecting cervical spine injury in pediatric trauma patients,This review aims to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine rule in a pediatric population evaluated for CSI following blunt trauma.,"The tests under evaluation are the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule, or tools in which the clinical variables contained four or more elements that are also part of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C-spine Rule.","To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule in a pediatric population evaluated for CSI following blunt trauma. Secondary objectives We expected to observe heterogeneity in the estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Factors that may contribute to heterogeneous results include: Differences in the healthcare setting and study design; previous studies state that CSI is seen less often in general emergency departments than in pediatric trauma hospitals, and that a CT of the neck is more common in general emergency departments (Adelgais 2014). Study quality, as assessed by the QUADAS-2 checklist (Whiting 2011). Age-related differences; we expect that both the applicability of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule and the type of injury will differ according to age in children younger and older than eight (Leonard 2013; Leonard 2014).","Radiographic imaging (plain radiography, CT or MRI or both) or clinical follow-up (if the index test was scored negative) were the reference standards. Follow-up was defined as clinical evaluation of the neck after removal of the neck collar (if worn) in the case of low-risk patients. The first clinical follow-up is performed in the emergency room during trauma evaluation. If cervical spine injury is suspected based on the index test, or after the first clinical follow-up, radiographic imaging is needed to rule out or define CSI. We included patients who underwent an eligible reference standard within 72 hours of presentation at the emergency department following blunt trauma. We also included patients who did not undergo radiographic imaging, but who obtained clinical follow-up directly during trauma evaluation during the first 72 hours.","The target condition was clinically-important CSI, defined as any fracture, dislocation, or ligamentous instability detectable by diagnostic imaging.","We Included children between the age of 0 and 18 who underwent blunt trauma evaluation in the emergency department. We excluded patients with a history of previous surgery of the cervical spine or congenital cervical spine anomalies, or both. In case of studies with mixed populations, e.g. that included some participants in the groups and that could not be separated from the eligible participants, we tried to contact the study author to provide the data for the group of interest.","We included studies that compared the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C-spine Rule, or both, with the reference standard. We considered diagnostic studies with cross-sectional or cohort designs (retrospective or prospective), and randomized controlled trials. We only included results from full reports. We preferred to include studies in which plain radiography, CT and MRI of the cervical spine was performed, since the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ligamentous and skeletal injury differ between those imaging modalities. However, we expected this triple combination to be very rare, due to multiple limitations (radiation consequences, availability, time and costs). We therefore also included studies in which only one of the reference standards was applied. For the same reason we also included studies in which no radiographic imaging was obtained but only clinical follow-up (in case of a negative index test). We expected that there would be studies in which all patients had undergone the reference standard without the index test being scored positive. We therefore also included studies in which those participants who had a negative result of the index test (no high-risk factors) still underwent one of the reference standards (for example, plain radiography). We excluded case-control studies because of the bias they might introduce. We preferred studies that evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule in direct comparisons to each other, but we did not exclude studies with indirect comparisons, because we expected the number of studies with direct comparisons to be limited.","[24165260, 16394912, 24035123, 23042928, 11717095, 19820570, 3813160, 21726860, 9867048, 2072419, 14695411, 12675623, 12632349, 20009681, 3049775, 6476515, 11423803, 10701614, 9003279, 3789288, 21068171, 3309353, 22057542, 12053848, 7796772, 15321867, 12748134, 21854487, 19433184, 2048847, 12913629, 21307733, 11003322, 23934962, 19875425, 19888020, 11385329, 1443841, 21644051, 20457772, 3387540, 11265034, 10420124, 15568161, 15039695, 10337876, 2920074, 17328258, 23019677, 12944893, 23357274, 11479837, 16096560, 2667407, 19741398, 10891516, 21785095, 11177091, 20192648, 18301348]","[3813160, 19433184, 10891516]"

The results of the index test were dichotomous; positive or negative. We assessed the results of the index test with the reference standard done at approximately same time. In the event of the index test identifying a different organism compared to the reference standard or identifying an organism when the reference standard was negative, we discussed among our author group as to whether we should discard or include as a false positive based on whether it was a contaminant or not. We analyzed subgroups of type of molecular assay namely broad-range conventional PCR, real-time PCR, PCR followed by post-PCR processing, multiplex PCR, staphylococcal PCR and fungal PCR. New tests/methodology may arrive in the future as the technology advances and we will address this by subgroup analyses and using year of publication as a covariate in future meta-analyses.

Microbial cultures are generally assumed to have low sensitivity but this decreased sensitivity has not been quantified. The low sensitivity of cultures in neonates may be due to the low degree of neonatal bacteremia or fungemia, small inoculation volumes in culture bottles and the use of intrapartum antibiotics. We documented the participant characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of people who were index test positive and reference standard negative to gain insight into the sensitivity of the reference standard. Alternative tests, such as evaluation of acute phase reactants or cytokines, are often used in conjunction with blood cultures but do not have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to replace microbial cultures as the reference standard.","Neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis, defined as a neonate with a positive culture of bacteria or fungi from the blood or CSF, or both.

CD011975,First trimester serum tests for Down's syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate), and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.","The following 18 index tests were examined; ADAM12, AFP, inhibin, PAPP-A, ITA, free βhCG, PlGF, SP1, total hCG, progesterone, uE3, GHBP, PGH, hyperglycosylated hCG, ProMBP, hPL, free αhCG, and free ßhCG to AFP ratio, and combinations of these markers combined with maternal age. We looked at comparisons of tests used in isolation and in 78 various combinations. These included single (one marker), double (two markers), triple (three markers), quadruple (four markers) and quintuple (five markers) tests, some of which were adjusted for maternal age.

We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.","We considered several reference standards, involving chromosomal verification and postnatal macroscopic inspection. Chromosomal verification is considered preferential but because of the risks involved, often not feasible. Where macroscopic inspection or examination raises a question about the possibility of an individual being affected by Down's syndrome, in clinical practice this is usually confirmed or refuted by formal karyotyping. Amniocentesis and CVS are invasive chromosomal verification tests undertaken during pregnancy. They are highly accurate but the process carries a 1% miscarriage rate, and therefore they are only used in pregnancies considered to be high risk of Down's, or on the mother's request. All other types of testing (postnatal examination, postnatal karyotyping, birth registers and Down’s syndrome registers) are based on information available at the end of pregnancy. For the purposes of meta-analysis they are considered equivalent. The greatest concern is not their accuracy, but the loss of the pregnancy to miscarriage between the timing of serum testing and the reference standard. Miscarriage with cytogenetic testing of the fetus is included in the reference standard where available. We anticipated that older studies, and studies undertaken in older women were more likely to have used invasive chromosomal verification tests in all women. Studies undertaken in younger women and more recent studies were likely to use differential verification as they often only used prenatal karyotypic testing on fetuses considered screen positive or high risk according to the screening test; the reference standard for most unaffected infants is likely to be observation of a phenotypically normal baby. Although the accuracy of this combined reference standard is considered high, it is methodologically a weaker approach because pregnancies that miscarry between the index test and birth are likely to be lost from the analysis, and miscarriage is more likely to occur in Down’s than normal pregnancies.","Down's syndrome in the fetus due to trisomy, translocation or mosaicism.","Pregnant women at less than 14 weeks' gestation confirmed by ultrasound, who had not undergone previous testing for Down’s syndrome in their pregnancy were eligible.

CD012009,Amylase in drain fluid for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in post-pancreatic resection,To determine the diagnostic accuracy of amylase in drain fluid at 48 hours or more for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection.,Drain fluid amylase.,"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of amylase in drain fluid at 48 hours or more for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection. Secondary objectives If we identified heterogeneity, we planned to explore heterogeneity by using the following sources of heterogeneity as covariate(s) in the regression model. Studies at low risk of bias in all the domains versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool, recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group) (Whiting 2006; Whiting 2011). Full-text publications versus abstracts (this can give an idea about publication bias since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication status) (Eloubeidi 2001). Prospective studies versus retrospective studies. Pancreatoduodenectomies versus distal pancreatic resection. Participants with cancers versus those with benign diseases. Different reference standards (confirmation by surgical resection in all participants versus a combination of surgical resection and clinical follow-up).","We planned to accept one of the following reference standards as per our review protocol. However, according to these reference standards we could not have included any studies as none of the studies reported used one of the two reference standards below. Pancreatic leak confirmed at surgery. This is confirmation of pancreatic leak at surgery usually on the basis of the presence of partial or complete separation of the anastomosis allowing leakage of contents, abdominal collections, or fistula (a tract between the anastomosis and exterior), and is a subjective decision made by the surgeon. Nevertheless, this is the best reference standard available. Pancreatic leak confirmed at surgery for participants with elevated amylase and clinical follow-up for a minimum period of six weeks (to ensure that they do not have complications due to pancreatic leak such as abdominal collections requiring drainage, intra-abdominal sepsis, generalised sepsis resulting from intra-abdominal sepsis, or mortality due to intra-abdominal sepsis) in people with negative amylase. The clinical follow-up should have included clinical examination of the patient, and may or may not have included radiological follow-up done as follow-up of suspected pancreatic leak or routine radiological follow-up to detect the recurrence of cancer. In retrospective studies, we accepted hospital records of physical examination of the patient after a minimum follow-up period of six weeks as an acceptable reference standard. The presence of one or more complications due to pancreatic leak such as abdominal collections requiring drainage, intra-abdominal sepsis, generalised sepsis resulting from intra-abdominal sepsis, or mortality due to intra-abdominal sepsis was considered as a positive reference standard. Because of the lack of any studies using one of the two reference standards mentioned above, we accepted ISGPF grades B and C POPF as reference standards. People with grade C POPF require surgery while those with grade B POPF usually do not undergo surgery but may require additional radiological drainage (Bassi 2005). These people with grade B POPF do not have systemic sepsis but have localised intra-abdominal infection. Although the intra-abdominal infections are usually because of pancreatic leaks in people undergoing pancreatic resection (these leaks are usually at least partially 'contained' (i.e. the effects limited) by the body's defence mechanism), one cannot be sure that the intra-abdominal infection was because of pancreatic leak. So, the reference standards used in this review might misclassify the target condition of pancreatic leak.",Clinically significant pancreatic leak (pancreatic leaks that require radiological or surgical intervention),People who have undergone pancreatic resection with drain fluid at least 48 hours after pancreatic resection irrespective of the volume of the drain fluid.,"We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of amylase in drain fluid for the diagnosis of clinically significant pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection excluding total pancreatectomy. We included studies that provided information on the index test and reference standards irrespective of language or publication status, or whether the data was collected prospectively or retrospectively. However, we excluded case reports that describe how the diagnosis of pancreatic leak was made on an individual participant or a group of participants and which did not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data, i.e. true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative. We also excluded case-control studies because these studies are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).","[18366393, 25579809, 26256914, 26019457, 26954894, 25563864, 24518514, 25322917, 22497944, 26155257, 21816438, 23025959, 22354484, 17667507, 16627213, 26278037, 11995494, 22504279, 25158227, 25809067, 26211439, 22481291, 12715232, 24887980, 24680573, 24622080, 14571810, 10339860, 21491103, 21594559, 23494109, 25112411, 24306817, 25024608, 25024627, 22539219, 27518469, 26117433, 20495641, 12846003, 25001423, 23804410, 23975030, 23838932, 3527104, 24420007]","[18366393, 23494109, 22539219, 23804410]"

We have therefore analysed and reported this information separately from the tests conducted on admission.","To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain. Secondary objectives We planned to explore the following sources of heterogeneity. Studies at low risk of bias in all of the domains versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool, recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group) (Whiting 2006; Whiting 2011). Prospective studies versus retrospective studies (to determine whether there is a difference in diagnostic accuracy between prospective and retrospective studies). Full-text publications versus abstracts (this can be indicative of publication bias since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication status) (Eloubeidi 2001). Previous history of acute pancreatitis. Different aetiology for acute pancreatitis (gallstone versus alcohol versus other aetiology). The accuracy of the test may depend upon the aetiology of the acute pancreatitis. Presence of organ failure. The accuracy of the test may depend upon the presence of organ failure. Average time to performance of the test. The accuracy of the test may depend upon the interval between the onset of clinical symptoms and the performance of the test. Different test manufacturers.","While inflammation of the pancreas confirmed by biopsy can be considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, for ethical reasons it is unlikely to be performed in any participant. As a result, different study authors may use different reference standards such as radiological features of acute pancreatitis or the presence of organ failure. However, such reference standards may miss some cases of mild acute pancreatitis, which will result in an underestimation of diagnostic test accuracy of the index tests. We also accepted the consensus conference definition of acute pancreatitis, that is when at least two of the following three features are present (Banks 2013). Acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain often radiating to the back. Serum lipase activity (or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal. Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on CECT, and less commonly on MRI or transabdominal ultrasonography. We also accepted any of the following reference standards, used alone or in combination: biopsy, radiological features of acute pancreatitis (CT or MRI), diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during laparotomy or autopsy, organ failure, or the consensus conference definition (including or excluding the index test being evaluated). In terms of ranking the reference standards, we considered biopsy to be the best reference standard (although for ethical reasons it is unlikely to have been performed in any participant) followed by the consensus definition of acute pancreatitis; radiological, laparotomy, or autopsy features of acute pancreatitis; or the presence of organ failure, in that order. However, we anticipated that the authors would exclude the test being assessed to be incorporated into the reference standard. For example, if serum amylase was being evaluated, the final diagnosis of acute pancreatitis would not depend upon the levels of serum amylase; this was not the case, as described below. If the test being assessed was incorporated into the reference standard, the diagnostic accuracy of the test would be overestimated.","Acute pancreatitis (regardless of severity: mild, moderately severe, or severe)","Adults with acute epigastric or diffuse abdominal pain (with or without previous history of acute pancreatitis and with or without systemic signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis), presenting to the hospital within three days of the onset of symptoms, irrespective of the interval between onset of symptoms and the time at which the test was performed.","We included studies that evaluated the accuracy of the index tests mentioned above in the appropriate patient population (see below). We included relevant studies irrespective of language or publication status (i.e. published as full text or abstract), whether the data were collected prospectively or retrospectively, and whether there was a comparison between the tests. However, we excluded case reports (which describe how the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made on an individual patient or a group of patients and which do not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data, i.e. true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative). We also excluded case-control studies because they are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).","[2409510, 2410163, 6200276, 6200277, 3966456, 94194, 15065538, 15777396, 2582402, 804139, 23303202, 21464582, 539206, 2383744, 4184942, 3937339, 1372152, 8955242, 955345, 3510097, 15264045, 10430383, 1706230, 7520847, 979600, 6085419, 27243230, 2467045, 9380098, 3562430, 14146747, 5714328, 980712, 2463138, 9187069, 6195978, 20517765, 1071539, 25263473, 27642079, 6197749, 18900648, 2440657, 942920, 2475281, 8760740, 8086522, 2580500, 7541479, 8190726, 6194921, 13486747, 6154284, 315099, 5648710, 6179559, 10606910, 5460418, 2422926, 2412998, 10088197, 6188148, 1719798, 11232685, 1706232, 19403887, 3757238, 1706231, 10223361, 512989, 13410166, 13669859, 9669641, 6204174, 5513770, 5486883, 462067, 1373698, 12850473, 4406762, 6174389, 95704, 14252748, 22585132, 742604, 9641955, 8830337, 13232158, 6201096, 11154486, 12763279, 2421389, 25215951, 18069761, 23105861, 6208075, 8602003, 1589255, 5602414, 7510410, 646567, 14840605, 1717539, 2424637, 9670716, 6188210, 76012, 2048012, 1526003, 10481560, 17119188, 23924492, 7528469, 1377146, 982210, 2432436, 17523321, 8653892, 1697797, 3415167, 2180035, 21946810, 2452330, 635294, 14145122, 6184470, 16437625, 15782102, 4829748, 1163973, 2412282, 9436862, 6172947, 2445987, 6186009, 2425437, 4420932, 10584507, 22669702, 14318393, 4175718, 704529, 5768021, 2420004, 14045606, 6076130, 2465844, 16628091, 6194630, 3750641, 4713225, 6160455, 10757870, 2437792, 2578102, 17058314, 14217753, 3494288, 4644009, 5781669, 7504593, 6653424, 4720152, 3719997, 517018, 2422514, 929110, 13215135, 6154908, 6974558, 15617303, 6207515, 1289419, 4699196, 19752771, 6192986, 4831310, 1168769, 13972219, 26204892, 673950, 6199049, 14242463, 1385018, 516204, 20094095, 617497, 14716811, 15943725, 6185717, 5070344, 9647391, 27160507, 4387817, 13263122, 2410080, 15220554, 2283565, 97129, 19241920, 7504396, 9915230, 5934214, 6159772, 2689525, 2580467, 6180850, 19409152, 7682533, 2443962, 4174882, 6180559, 2470559, 668141, 599005, 6161410, 10508122, 6197334, 13830443, 10859041, 2417752, 25062872, 14141910, 1374275, 7543034, 2426009, 2479316, 8962760, 870964, 5871894, 556168, 2413755, 1373336, 4713507, 2580501, 5975327, 4691868, 2446694, 25883434, 22481290, 17332967, 5132218, 741837, 2408789, 605280, 21410075, 11577303, 13427164, 1377145, 1718808, 2421494, 9580441, 9414980, 13434588, 8945483, 25665541, 6160273, 7506911, 11552931, 16286272, 6189637, 615728, 7517087, 463848, 1117961, 1698001, 11005413, 2408820, 3493889, 13233053, 10189802, 13823931, 6166238, 11932783, 9449444, 86264, 15233697, 2471840, 3492742, 2478412, 890263, 308871, 2477176, 6178457, 2466075, 4774862, 6197602, 652610, 22374894, 3064262, 6166043, 1630081, 3910885, 5819278, 7514550, 10235200, 20218362, 11854688, 6208966, 21755760, 2438738, 2438739, 11569688, 4731045, 23002153, 4639859, 9351056, 729946, 2471244, 22993927, 793179, 2476863, 1373676, 2471605, 12143219, 2323064, 3704296, 2447209, 11156345, 13640152, 1983856, 9255526, 6205229, 9235442, 15502646, 6184701, 17657841, 1707260, 11293447, 1278723, 6163295, 8272757, 21792081, 178106, 8061339, 15286966, 2447617, 11719473, 3459430]","[1697797, 16437625, 9436862, 19241920, 5934214, 2446694, 22481290, 21755760, 1983856]"
CD012019,Urinary biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis,"Primary 1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal or ovarian or deep infiltrating, or a combination thereof) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. 2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. Urinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery as well as triage tests which would assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.","Any type of urinary biomarker for endometriosis was assessed either separately or in combination with other urine tests. The assessed index tests are presented in Table 2. We included the tests performed in one or several phases of menstrual cycle. The combined evaluations of urinary biomarkers with other methods for diagnosing endometriosis (e.g. pelvic examination, imaging, blood or endometrial tests) are beyond the scope of this review and are presented separately in another review 'Combined tests for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis'. The studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, qualitative descriptions of lesion appearance or inter-observer variability of the index tests without reporting the data on diagnostic performance were excluded from the review. When the evaluated biomarker(s) showed differential expression between the groups of women with and without endometriosis, the publication was considered only if the data were reported with sufficient detail for the construction of 2 x 2 contingency tables. However, when the contingency tables were not available because the expression level of index test did not significantly differ between the groups and the inclusion criteria were otherwise met, a critical appraisal was undertaken and the study was presented in the descriptive part of the review. Thus the adequately designed studies that identified biomarkers without diagnostic value were evaluated as they provide information that is likely to focus future research on other more clinically useful biomarkers. This methodology also identified biomarkers which were associated with endometriosis in some but not other publications. Evaluations of screening or predictive accuracy tests were not included in this review. The diagnostic performance of an index test was considered to be high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 94% with specificity of equal or greater than 79%) or triage test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 95% with specificity of equal or greater than 50% or vice versa), or approached these criteria (diagnostic estimates within 5% of the set thresholds). All other diagnostic estimates were considered to be low.","Primary  1.

To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. Urinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery as well as triage tests which would assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis. Secondary objectives 1. To investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for endometriosis. Potential sources of heterogeneity include: Characteristics of the study population: age (adolescents vs. later reproductive years); clinical presentation (subfertility, pelvic pain, ovarian mass, asymptomatic women); stage of disease (rASRM classification system); geographic location of study; Histological confirmation in conjunction with laparoscopic visualisation compared to laparoscopic visualisation alone; Changes in technology over time: year of publication; modifications applied to conventional laboratory techniques; Methodological quality: differences in the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) evaluation (Table 3), including a) low versus unclear or high risk; b) consecutive versus non-consecutive enrolment; c) blinding of surgeons to the results of index tests; Table 3. Application of the QUADAS-2 tool for assessment of methodological quality of the included studies Domain 1 - Patient selection Description Describe methods of patient selection and included patients Type of bias assessed Selection bias, spectrum bias Review Question Women of reproductive age with clinically suspected endometriosis (symptoms, clinical examination ± presence of pelvic mass), scheduled for surgical exploration of pelvic/abdominal cavity for confirmation of the diagnosis ± treatment Informaton collected Study objectives, study population, selection (inclusion and exclusion criteria), study design, clinical presentation, age, number of participants enrolled and number of participants available for analysis, setting, place and period of the study Signalling question 1 Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? Yes If a consecutive sample or a random sample of the eligible patients was included in the study No If non-consecutive sample or non-random sample of the eligible patients was included in the study Unclear If this information was unclear Signalling question 2 Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? Yes If inclusion/exclusion criteria were presented and all patients with suspected endometriosis were included, with an exception for those who a) had a history of medical conditions or were on medical therapy that would have potentially interfered with interpretation of index test (e.g. malignancy, pregnancy, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, treatment with hormonal or immunomodulator substances); b) refused to participate in the study; or c) were unfit for surgery No If the study excluded the patients based on education level, psychosocial factors, genetic testing or phenotype or excluded patients with any co-morbidities commonly present in general population, including a population that could have undergone a testing for endometriosis in clinical setting (hypertension, asthma, obesity, benign gastro-intestinal or renal disease, etc) Unclear If the study did not provide clear definition of the selection (inclusion or exclusion) criteria and 'no' judgement was not applicable Signalling question 3 Was a 'two-gate' design avoided? Yes If the study had a single set of inclusion criteria, defined by the clinical presentation (i.e. only participants in whom the target condition is suspected) - a ‘single-gate’ study design No If the study had more than one set of inclusion criteria in respect to clinical presentation (i.e. participants suspected of target condition and participants with alternative diagnosis in whom the target condition would not be suspected in clinical practice) - a 'two-gate' study design Unclear If it was unclear whether a 'two-gate deign' was avoided or not Risk of bias Could the selection of patients have introduced bias? Low If 'yes' classification for all the above 3 questions High If 'no' classification for any of the above 3 questions Unclear If 'unclear' classification for 3 of the above questions and 'high risk' judgement was not applicable Concerns about applicability Are there concerns that the included patients do not match the review question? Low If the study includes only clinically relevant population that would have undergone index test in real practice and includes representative form of target condition High If the study population differed from the population defined in the review question in terms of demographic features and co-morbidity (e.g. studies with multiple sets of inclusion criteria with respect to clinical presentation including either healthy controls or alternative diagnosis controls that would not have undergone index test in real practice). Further, if target condition diagnosed in the study population was not representative of the entire spectrum of disease, such as limited spectrum of severity (e.g. only mild forms) or limited type of endometriosis (e.g. only DIE) Unclear If this information was unclear (e.g. severity of endometriosis was not reported) Domain 2 - Index test Description Describe the index test, how it was conducted and interpreted Type of bias assessed Test review bias, clinical review bias, interobserver variation bias Review Question Any type of urinary biomarkers Informaton collected Index test name, description of positive case definition by index test as reported, threshold for positive result, examiners (number, level of expertise, blinding), interobserver variability, conflict of interests Signalling question 1 Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard? Yes If the operators performing or interpreting index test were unaware of the results of reference standard No If the operators performing or interpreting index test were not blinded to the results of reference standard Unclear If this information was unclear Signalling question 2 If a threshold was used, was it pre-specified? Yes If study clearly provided a threshold for positive result and was defined before execution or interpretation of index test No If a threshold for positive result was not provided or not defined prior to test execution Unclear If it was unclear whether a threshold was pre-specified or not Signalling question 3 Was a menstrual cycle phase considered in interpreting the index test? Yes If all the included participants were in the same phase of menstrual cycle or if the study reported subgroup analyses per cycle phase or if study reported the pooled estimates after impact of the cycle phase on biomarker expression was not detected No If study included participants in different phases of menstrual cycle, but effect of cycle phase on index test was not assessed Unclear If the cycle phase was not reported Risk of bias Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?

Low We considered all types of urinary biomarkers as eligible; therefore all the included studies were classified as 'low concern', unless 'unclear' judgement was applicable High We did not consider the studies where index tests other than urinary biomarkers were included (or excluded information on other index tests reported in addition to urine tests) or where index test looked at other target conditions not specified in the review (e.g. studies aimed at classifying pelvic masses as benign and malignant); therefore none of the included studies was classified as 'high concern' Unclear If study did not present sufficient information on at least one of the following: laboratory method, sample handling, reagents used, experience of the test operators Domain 3 - Reference standard Description Describe the reference standard, how it was conducted and interpreted Type of bias assessed Verification bias, bias in estimation of diagnostic accuracy due to inadequate reference standard Review Question Target condition - pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, DIE. Reference standard - visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation Informaton collected Target condition, prevalence of target condition in the sample, reference standard, description of positive case definition by reference test as reported, examiners (number, level of expertise, blinding) Signalling question 1 Were the reference standards likely to correctly classify the target condition? Yes If the study reported at least one of the following: surgical procedure was described in sufficient details; or criteria for positive reference standard were stated; or diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology; or the procedure was performed by the team with high level of expertise in diagnosis/surgical treatment of target condition, including tertiary referral centres for endometriosis No If reference standard did not classify target condition correctly; considering the inclusion criteria and a nature of the reference standard, none of the studies were classified as 'no' for this item Unclear If information on execution of the reference standard, its interpretation or operators was unclear Signalling question 2 Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index tests? Yes If operators performing the reference test were unaware of the results of index test No If operators performing the reference test were aware of the results of index test Unclear If this information was unclear Risk of bias Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?

Low Considering the inclusion criteria, all the studies were classified as 'low concern', therefore all the included studies were classified as 'low concern' High We excluded the studies where participants did not undergo surgery for diagnosis of endometriosis, therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'high concern' Unclear Only studies were laparoscopy/laparotomy served as a reference test were included; therefore none of the included studies was classified as 'unclear concern' Domain 4 - Flow and timing Description Describe any patients who did not receive the index tests or reference standard or who were excluded from the 2 x 2 table, describe the interval and any interventions between index tests (sample collection) and the reference standard Type of bias assessed Disease progression bias, bias of diagnostic performance due to missing data Review Question Less than 12 months interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard - endometriosis may progress over time, so we had chosen an arbitrary time interval of 12 months as an acceptable time interval between the sample collection and surgical confirmation of diagnosis Informaton collected Time interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard, withdrawals (overall number reported and if were explained) Signalling question 1 Was there an appropriate interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard? Yes If time interval was reported and was less than 12 months No We excluded all the studies where time interval was longer than 12 months, therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'no' for this item Unclear If time interval was not stated clearly, but authors' description allowed to assume that the interval was reasonably short Signalling question 2 Did all women receive the same reference standard? Yes If all participants underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy as a reference standard; considering the inclusion criteria, all the studies were classified as 'yes' for this item, as anticipated No If all participants did not undergo surgery or had alternative reference standard or if only a subset of participants had surgery as reference standard, but the information on this population was not available in isolation; considering the inclusion criteria, none of the included studies were classified as 'no' for this item Unclear If this information was unclear; considering the inclusion criteria, none of the included studies were classified as 'unclear' for this item Signalling question 3 Were all women included in the analysis? Yes If all the women were included in the analysis or if women were excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria prior to execution of index test or if the withdrawals were less than 5% of the enrolled population (arbitrary selected cut-off) No If any patients were excluded from the analysis because of un interpretable results, inability to undergo either index test or reference standard or for unclear reasons Unclear If this information was unclear Risk of bias Could the patient flow have introduced bias? Low If 'yes' classification for all the above 3 questions High If 'no' classification for any of the above 3 questions Unclear If 'unclear' classification for any of the above 3 questions and 'high risk' judgement was not applicable Study design ('single-gate design' vs. 'two-gate design' studies). 2. To assess biomarkers which were not affected by endometriosis and hence were unlikely to discriminate between women with and without the disease.","The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. Information regarding the inter- and intra-observer correlation of the reference standard was reviewed if reported. Only studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the urine sample collection were included, on the assumption that disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, either naturally or as a result of treatment. Studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard or where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for undertaking the reference standard were not included in this review.","Pelvic endometriosis, defined as endometrial tissue located in the pelvic cavity: any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas. Three types of pelvic endometriosis were assessed: 1. Peritoneal endometriosis, defined as endometrial deposits detected on peritoneum covering pelvic organs, pelvic side walls or pouch of Douglas; 2. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma), defined as an ovarian cyst lined by endometrial tissue and appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size; 3. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, i.e. when the endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space for a distance of 5 mm or more (Koninckx 1991). DIE may be present in multiple locations, involving either anterior or posterior pelvic compartments, or both. Certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis were not included in this review because the majority were reported in case reports or case series and laparoscopy or laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded the studies where diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome of the trial (e.g. malignant vs benign masses or normal vs. abnormal pelvis) and the separate data for endometriosis were not available. We also excluded the studies where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard, because this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of index test. We included studies that recruited selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. those with specific rASRM stages), because there is a poor correlation between the rASRM classification and infertility and pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in a loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. Where possible the impact of these studies was addressed in the assessments of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported a sub-group analysis of the different stages of disease severity, only estimates for the entire population were considered, because a subgroup analysis does not directly address the review question regarding the clinical utility of the biomarker in detecting the disease.","Study participants included reproductive-aged women (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms or pelvic examination, or both, who undertook both the index test and reference standard. The participants were selected from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications: 1) clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination, or a combination of the above), 2) ovarian mass regardless of symptoms, 3) a mixed group, which consists of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus, etc). Asymptomatic women who have an incidental finding of endometriosis at surgery performed for another indication were also included Articles that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when the data for the reproductive age group was available in isolation. Studies were excluded when the study population involved participants who clearly would not undergo the index test in a clinical scenario or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies, gynaecological malignancy or acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications where only a subset of participants with a positive index test or reference standard were included in the analysis and the data for the whole cohort were not available.","Published peer-reviewed studies that compared the results of one or several types of urinary biomarkers with the results obtained by surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. Studies were included if they were: Randomised controlled trials; Observational studies of the following designs: ‘Single-gate design’ (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis. ‘Two-gate design’ (studies where participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and also participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two-gate studies were eligible only where all cases and controls belonged to the same population in respect to the reference standard (i.e. all the participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005). Performed on prospectively collected samples, irrespective of the actual time of the test assay. The timing of sample collection relative to surgery is important because the surgical excision of endometriotic lesions could influence urine biomarker expression and hence bias the results. Therefore, we only included studies where urine was collected before the surgical procedure, i.e. 'prospectively collected'. The studies performed on tissue bank samples collected from prospectively recruited, well-defined populations were considered eligible, which prevented the omission of valuable data from adequately designed studies. The time interval between sample collection and laboratory testing may influence test outcomes which could be dependent on sample storage conditions and the stability of each individual biomarker during storage and freeze/thawing. This information was not readily available for most molecules and was not addressed in this review, but will be considered in future updates if more evidence emerges. Performed in any healthcare setting; Published in any language; We did not impose a minimal limit on the number of participants in the included studies nor the number of studies that have evaluated each index test. The following studies were excluded: Study design: Narrative or systematic reviews; Studies of retrospective design where the sample collection was performed after execution of reference test; Studies of retrospective design where the participants were selected from retrospective review of the case notes/archived samples and information on recruitment methods or study population was not available; Case reports or case series; Studies reported only in abstract form or in conference proceedings where the full text was not available. This limitation was applied when we faced substantial difficulty in obtaining the information from the abstracts, which precluded a reliable assessment of eligibility and methodological quality.","[25284053, 22158084, 18558423]",[22158084]

whole tissue sample or separate endometrial compartments and reported them the same way as presented by the authors (e.g. separate testing of glandular epithelium, stromal cells or mixed cell sample). We included tests performed in one or several phases of the menstrual cycle. The combined evaluations of endometrial biomarkers with other methods for diagnosing endometriosis (e.g. pelvic examination or blood tests) are beyond the scope of this review and are presented separately in another review: 'Combined tests for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis'. We excluded the studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, qualitative descriptions of lesion appearance or interobserver variability of the index tests without reporting the data on diagnostic performance. We only considered studies in which the evaluated biomarker(s) showed differential expression between the groups of women with and without endometriosis if the data were reported in sufficient detail for the construction of 2 × 2 contingency tables. We included studies in which the expression levels of the index test did not significantly differ between the groups and where contingency tables were not available, as long as the inclusion criteria were met otherwise. We considered these to be studies reporting unchanged biomarker expression in the presence of endometriosis, and we presented them in the descriptive portion of the review. Thus, we evaluated the adequately designed studies that identified biomarkers without diagnostic value, as they provide information that is likely to guide future research towards other more clinically useful biomarkers. This methodology also identified biomarkers that presented conflicting findings associated with endometriosis in some but not other publications. We considered the diagnostic performance of an index test to be high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity at or above 94% with specificity at or above 79%) or triage test (sensitivity at or above 95% with specificity at or above 50% or vice versa), or approached these criteria (diagnostic estimates within 5% of the set thresholds). We considered all other diagnostic estimates to be low.","Primary objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the endometrial biomarkers for pelvic endometriosis, using a surgical diagnosis as the reference standard. We evaluated the tests as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. Secondary objectives To investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial biomarkers for endometriosis. Potential sources of heterogeneity include: participant characteristics: age (adolescents versus later reproductive years), clinical presentation (subfertility, pelvic pain, ovarian mass, asymptomatic women), stage of disease (rASRM classification system), geographic location of study; histological confirmation in conjunction with laparoscopic visualisation compared to laparoscopic visualisation alone; changes in technology over time: year of publication, modifications applied to conventional laboratory techniques; methodological quality: differences in the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) evaluation (Table 2), including low versus unclear or high risk; consecutive versus non-consecutive enrolment; and blinding of surgeons to the results of index tests; Table 2.

Yes If all the included participants were in the same phase of menstrual cycle, if the study reported subgroup analyses per cycle phase, or if study reported the pooled estimates after impact of the cycle phase on biomarker expression was not detected No If study included participants in different phases of menstrual cycle, but effect of cycle phase on index test was not assessed Unclear If the cycle phase was not reported Risk of bias Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?

To assess the biomarkers that were not affected by endometriosis and hence are unlikely to discriminate between patients with and without the disease.","The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. If reported, we reviewed information regarding the inter- and intraobserver correlation of the reference standard. We only included studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the sample collection, on the assumption that disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, either naturally or as a result of treatment. We excluded studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard or where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for undertaking the reference standard, as this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test.","Pelvic endometriosis, defined as endometrial tissue located in the pelvic cavity: involving any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas. We assessed three types of pelvic endometriosis. Peritoneal endometriosis, defined as endometrial deposits detected on peritoneum covering pelvic organs, pelvic side walls or pouch of Douglas. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma), defined as an ovarian cyst lined by endometrial tissue, appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, i.e. when the endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space at a distance of 5 mm or more (Koninckx 1991). DIE may be present in multiple locations, involving either the anterior or posterior pelvic compartments, or both. We did not include certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis because the majority were reported in case reports or case series, and laparoscopy or laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded the studies where diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome (e.g. malignant versus benign masses or normal versus abnormal pelvis) and separate data for endometriosis was not available. We did include studies that recruited selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. those with specific rASRM stages), because there is a poor correlation between the rASRM classification and infertility or pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in the loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. Where possible, we addressed the impact of these studies in the assessment of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported a subgroup analysis of the different stages of disease severity, we only considered estimates for the entire population. This is because a subgroup analysis would not directly address the review question regarding the clinical utility of the biomarker in disease detection.","Study participants included reproductive-aged women (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms, pelvic examination or both, who undertook the index test as well as the reference standard.  came from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications. Clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination, or a combination of the above). Ovarian mass, regardless of symptoms. A mixed group consisting of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus, etc). Asymptomatic women who have an incidental finding of endometriosis at surgery performed for another indication. Articles that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when the data for the reproductive age group was available in isolation. We excluded studies with participants that clearly would not undergo the index test in the relevant clinical situation or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies or acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications that only analysed participants with a positive index test or reference standard and did not provide data for the whole cohort.","Published peer-reviewed studies that compared the results of one or several types of eutopic endometrial biomarker tests with the results obtained by surgical visualisation of lesions for the diagnosis of endometriosis. We included the following types of studies. Randomised controlled trials. Observational studies with the following designs. 'Single-gate design' (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis. 'Two-gate design' (studies where participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and also participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two-gate studies were eligible only where all cases and controls belonged to the same population with respect to the reference standard (i.e. all the participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005). Studies performed on prospectively collected samples, irrespective of the actual time of the test assay. The timing of sample collection relative to surgery is important because the surgical excision of endometriotic lesions could influence endometrial biomarker expression and hence bias the results. Therefore, we only included studies where the biological sample was collected before the surgical procedure, i.e. 'prospectively collected'. We considered to be eligible the studies performed on tissue bank samples collected from prospectively recruited, well-defined populations, which prevented the omission of valuable data from adequately designed studies. The time interval between sample collection and laboratory testing may influence test outcomes, which could be dependent on sample storage conditions and the stability of each individual biomarker during storage and freeze-thawing. This information was not readily available for most molecules, and we did not address it in this review, but we will consider it in future updates if more evidence emerges. We did not impose limits on eligibility related to the healthcare settings where the study took place, the language of publication, the number of participants in the included studies or the number of studies that evaluated each index test. We excluded the following types of studies. Narrative or systematic reviews. Studies of retrospective design where investigators collected samples after execution of the reference test. Studies of retrospective design where investigators selected participants from retrospective review of the case notes/archived samples and where information on recruitment methods or study population was not available. Case reports or case series. Studies reported only in abstract form or in conference proceedings where the full text was not available.

CD012179,Blood biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis,"To evaluate blood biomarkers as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. Specific objectives include the following. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers for the diagnosis of peritoneal, ovarian and deep infiltrating pelvic endometriosis, compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses.","We assessed any type of blood-based biomarker for endometriosis either separately or in combination with other blood tests. We included index tests performed on whole blood, plasma or serum. We present the assessed index tests in Table 2 (classified by biological subgroups) and in Appendix 1 (alphabetical order with annotation for biological subgroups). We included the tests performed in one or several phases of menstrual cycle. The combined evaluations of blood biomarkers with other methods for diagnosing endometriosis (e.g. pelvic examination, imaging, urine or endometrial tests) are beyond the scope of this review and are presented separately in another review, 'Combined tests for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis'. We excluded studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, presented qualitative descriptions of lesion appearance or reported interobserver variability of the index tests, without reporting the data on diagnostic performance. When the evaluated biomarker(s) showed differential expression between the groups of women with and without endometriosis, we only considered the study if it reported data with sufficient detail for the construction of 2 x 2 contingency tables. However, when the contingency tables were not available because the expression level of index test did not significantly differ between the groups and the inclusion criteria were otherwise met, we made a critical appraisal and presented the study in the descriptive part of the review. Thus, we evaluated the adequately designed studies that identified biomarkers without diagnostic value, as they provide information that is likely to focus future research on other more clinically useful biomarkers.This methodology also identified biomarkers that were associated with endometriosis in some but not other studies. We did not include evaluations of screening or predictive accuracy tests in this review. We considered the diagnostic performance of an index test to be high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 0.94 with specificity of equal or greater than 0.79) or triage test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 0.95 with specificity of equal or greater than 0.50 or vice versa) or approached these criteria (diagnostic estimates within 0.05 of the set thresholds). We considered all other diagnostic estimates to be low.","Primary objectives To evaluate blood biomarkers as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. Specific objectives include the following. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers for the diagnosis of peritoneal, ovarian and deep infiltrating pelvic endometriosis, compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. Secondary objectives To investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers for endometriosis. Potential sources of heterogeneity include: participant characteristics: age (adolescents versus later reproductive years), clinical presentation (subfertility, pelvic pain, ovarian mass, asymptomatic women), stage of disease (rASRM classification system), geographic location of study; histological confirmation in conjunction with laparoscopic visualisation compared to laparoscopic visualisation alone; changes in technology over time: year of publication, modifications applied to conventional laboratory techniques; methodological quality: differences in the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) evaluation (Table 3), including low versus unclear or high risk; consecutive versus non-consecutive enrolment; and blinding of surgeons to the results of index tests; Table 3. Application of the QUADAS-2 tool for assessment of methodological quality of the included studies Domain 1 - Patient selection   Description Describe methods of patient selection and included patients   Type of bias assessed Selection bias, spectrum bias   Review Question Women of reproductive age with clinically suspected endometriosis (symptoms, clinical examination ± presence of pelvic mass), scheduled for surgical exploration of pelvic/abdominal cavity for confirmation of the diagnosis ± treatment   Informaton collected Study objectives, study population, selection (inclusion/exclusion criteria), study design, clinical presentation, age, number of enrolled and number of available for analysis, setting, place and period of the study   Signalling question 1 Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled?   Yes If a consecutive sample or a random sample of the eligible participants was included in the study   No If a consecutive sample or a random sample of the eligible participants was not included in the study   Unclear If this information was unclear   Signalling question 2 Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?   Yes If inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented and all participants with suspected endometriosis were included, with an exception for those who either had a history of medical conditions or were on medical therapy that would have potentially interfered with interpretation of index test (e.g. malignancy, pregnancy, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, treatment with hormonal or immunomodulator substances); refused to participate in the study; or were unfit for surgery   No If the study excluded the participants based on education level, psychosocial factors, genetic testing or phenotype or excluded participants with any comorbidities commonly present in general population, including a population that could have undergone a testing for endometriosis in clinical setting (hypertension, asthma, obesity, benign gastrointestinal or renal disease, etc)   Unclear If the study did not provide clear definition of the selection (inclusion/exclusion) criteria and 'no' judgement was not applicable   Signalling question 3 Was a 'two-gate' design avoided?   Yes If the study had a single set of inclusion criteria, defined by the clinical presentation (i.e. only participants in whom the target condition is suspected) - a single-gate design   No If the study had more than one set of inclusion criteria in respect to clinical presentation (i.e. participants suspected of target condition and participants with alternative diagnosis in whom the target condition would not be suspected in clinical practice) - a two-gate study design   Unclear If it was unclear whether a two-gate deign was avoided or not   Risk of bias Could the selection of patients have introduced bias?

Low If the study includes only clinically relevant population that would have undergone index test in real practice and includes representative form of target condition   High If the study population differed from the population defined in the review question in terms of demographic features and comorbidity (e.g. studies with multiple sets of inclusion criteria with respect to clinical presentation including either healthy controls or alternative diagnosis controls that would not have undergone index test in real practice). Further, if target condition diagnosed in the study population was not representative of the entire spectrum of disease, such as limited spectrum of severity (e.g. only mild forms) or limited type of endometriosis (e.g. only deep infiltrating endometriosis)   Unclear If this information was unclear (e.g. severity of endometriosis was not reported)   Domain 2 - Index test   Description Describe the index test, how it was conducted and interpreted   Type of bias assessed Test review bias, clinical review bias, interobserver variation bias   Review question Any type of blood-based biomarker   Informaton collected Index test name, description of positive case definition by index test as reported, threshold for positive result, examiners (number, level of expertise, blinding), interobserver variability, conflict of interests   Signalling question 1 Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?   Yes If the operators performing/interpreting index test were unaware of the results of the reference standard   No If the operators performing/interpreting index test were not blinded to the results of the reference standard   Unclear If this information was unclear   Signalling question 2 If a threshold was used, was it pre-specified?   Yes If study clearly provided a threshold for positive result and was defined before execution/interpretation of index test   No If a threshold for positive result was not provided or not defined prior to test execution   Unclear If it was unclear whether a threshold was pre-specified or not   Signalling question 3 Was a menstrual cycle phase considered in interpreting the index test?   Yes If all the included participants were in the same phase of menstrual cycle, if the study reported subgroup analyses per cycle phase, or if study reported the pooled estimates after impact of the cycle phase on biomarker expression was not detected   No If study included participants in different phases of menstrual cycle, but effect of cycle phase on index test was not assessed   Unclear If the cycle phase was not reported   Risk of bias Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?   Low If 'yes' classification for all the above 3 questions   High If 'no' classification for any of the above 3 questions   Unclear If 'unclear' classification for any of the above 3 questions and 'high risk' judgement was not applicable   Concerns about applicability Are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or interpretation differ from the review question?   Low We considered all types of blood-based biomarkers as eligible, therefore all the included studies were classified as 'low concern', unless 'unclear' judgement was applicable   High We did not consider the studies where index tests other than blood-based biomarkers were included (or excluded information on other index tests reported in addition to blood tests) or where index test looked at other target conditions not specified in the review (e.g. studies aimed at classifying pelvic masses as benign and malignant); therefore none of the included studies was classified as 'high concern'   Unclear If study reported, but did not present sufficient information on any of the following: laboratory method, sample handling, reagents used or experience of the test operators   Domain 3 - Reference standard   Description Describe the reference standard, how it was conducted and interpreted   Type of bias assessed Verification bias, bias in estimation of diagnostic accuracy due to inadequate reference standard   Review question Target condition - pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, deep infiltrating endometriosis.

Yes If the study reported at least one of the following: surgical procedure was described in sufficient detail; criteria for positive reference standard were stated; diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology; or the procedure was performed by a team with high level of expertise in diagnosis/surgical treatment of target condition, including tertiary referral centres for endometriosis   No If reference standard did not classify target condition correctly; considering the inclusion criteria and nature of the reference standard, none of the studies were classified as 'no' for this item   Unclear If information on execution of the reference standard, its interpretation or operators was unclear   Signalling question 2 Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index tests?   Yes If operators performing the reference test were unaware of the results of the index test   No If operators performing the reference test were aware of the results of the index test   Unclear If this information was unclear   Risk of bias Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?   Low If 'yes' classification for both of the above 2 questions   High If 'no' classification for any of the above 2 questions   Unclear If 'unclear' classification for any of the above 2 questions and 'high risk' judgement was not applicable   Concerns about applicability Are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the question?   Low Considering the inclusion criteria, all the studies were classified as 'low concern', unless 'unclear' judgement was applicable   High We excluded the studies where participants did not undergo surgery for diagnosis of endometriosis; therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'high concern'   Unclear Only studies where laparoscopy/laparotomy served as a reference test were included; therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'unclear concern'   Domain 4 - Flow and timing   Description Describe any participants who did not receive the index tests or reference standard or who were excluded from the 2 x 2 table; describe the interval and any interventions between index tests (sample collection) and the reference standard   Type of bias assessed Disease progression bias, bias of diagnostic performance due to missing data   Review question Less than 12-month interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard - endometriosis may progress over the time, so we had chosen an arbitrary time interval of 12 months as an acceptable time interval between the index test and surgical confirmation of diagnosis   Informaton collected Time interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard, withdrawals (overall number of reported and if explanation)   Signalling question 1 Was there an appropriate interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard?   Yes If time interval was reported and was less than 12 months   No We excluded all the studies where time interval was longer than 12 months; therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'no' for this item   Unclear If time interval was not stated clearly, but authors description allowed us to assume that the interval was reasonably short   Signalling question 2 Did all patients receive the same reference standard?   Yes If all participants underwent laparoscopy/laparotomy as a reference standard. Considering the inclusion criteria, all the studies were classified as 'yes' for this item, as anticipated   No If all participants did not undergo surgery or had alternative reference standard or if only a subset of participants had surgery as reference standard, but the information on this population was not available in isolation   Unclear If this information was unclear. Considering the inclusion criteria, none of the included studies were classified as 'unclear' for this item   Signalling question 3 Were all patients included in the analysis?   Yes If all the participants were included in the analysis or if the participants were excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria prior to execution of index test or if the withdrawals were less than 5% of the enrolled population (arbitrary selected cut-off)   No If any participants were excluded from the analysis because of uninterpretable results, inability to undergo either index test or reference standard, or unclear reasons   Unclear If this information was unclear   Risk of bias Could the patient flow have introduced bias?   Low If 'yes' classification for all the above 3 questions   High If 'no' classification for any of the above 3 questions   Unclear If 'unclear' classification for any of the above 3 questions and 'high risk' judgement was not applicable   study design (single-gate design versus two-gate design studies). To assess biomarkers that were not affected by endometriosis and hence were unlikely to discriminate between women with and without the disease.","The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. If reported, we reviewed information regarding the inter- and intraobserver correlation of the reference standard. We only included studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the blood sample collection, on the assumption that disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, either naturally or as a result of treatment. We excluded studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard or where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for undertaking the reference standard, as this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test.","Pelvic endometriosis, defined as endometrial tissue located in the pelvic cavity: involving any of the following: pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas. We assessed three types of pelvic endometriosis. Peritoneal endometriosis, defined as endometrial deposits detected on peritoneum covering pelvic organs, pelvic side walls or pouch of Douglas. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma), defined as an ovarian cyst lined by endometrial tissue, appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, i.e. when the endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space at a distance of 5 mm or more (Koninckx 1991). DIE may be present in multiple locations, involving either the anterior or posterior pelvic compartments, or both. We did not include certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis because the majority were reported in case reports or case series, and laparoscopy or laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded the studies where diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome (e.g. malignant versus benign masses or normal versus abnormal pelvis) and separate data for endometriosis was not available. We also excluded the studies where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard, because this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test. We did include studies that recruited selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. those with specific rASRM stages), because there is a poor correlation between the rASRM classification and infertility or pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in the loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. Where possible, we addressed the impact of these studies in the assessment of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported a subgroup analysis of the different stages of disease severity, we only considered estimates for the entire population. This is because a subgroup analysis would not directly address the review question regarding the clinical utility of the biomarker in disease detection.","Study participants included reproductive-aged women (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms, pelvic examination or both, who undertook the index test as well as the reference standard.  came from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications. Clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination, or a combination of the above). Ovarian mass, regardless of symptoms. A mixed group consisting of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus, etc). Asymptomatic women who have an incidental finding of endometriosis at surgery performed for another indication. Studies that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when the data for the reproductive age group was available in isolation. We excluded studies with participants that clearly would not undergo the index test in the relevant clinical situation or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies or acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications that only analysed participants with a positive index test or reference standard and did not provide data for the whole cohort.","Published peer-reviewed studies that compared the results of one or several types of blood biomarker tests with the results obtained from a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. We included the following types of studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies with the following designs. Single-gate design (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis. Two-gate design (studies where participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and also participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two-gate studies were eligible only where all cases and controls belonged to the same population with respect to the reference standard (i.e. all the participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005). Studies performed on prospectively collected samples, irrespective of the actual time of the test assay. The timing of sample collection relative to surgery is important because the surgical excision of endometriotic lesions could influence blood biomarker expression and hence bias the results. Therefore, we only included studies that drew blood before the surgical procedure, i.e. 'prospectively collected'. We considered to be eligible the studies performed on tissue bank samples collected from prospectively recruited, well-defined populations, which prevented the omission of valuable data from adequately designed studies. The time interval between sample collection and laboratory testing may influence test outcomes, which could be dependent on sample storage conditions and the stability of each individual biomarker during storage and freeze-thawing. This information was not readily available for most molecules, and we did not address it in this review, but we will consider it in future updates if more evidence emerges. We did not impose limits on eligibility related to the healthcare settings where the study took place, the language of publication, the number of participants in the included studies or the number of studies that evaluated each index test. We excluded the following types of studies. Narrative or systematic reviews. Studies of retrospective design where investigators collected samples after execution of the reference test. Studies of retrospective design where investigators selected participants from retrospective review of the case notes/archived samples and where information on recruitment methods or study population was not available. Case reports or case series. Studies reported only in abstract form or in conference proceedings where the full text was not available. We applied this limitation after facing substantial difficulty in obtaining the information from the abstracts, which precluded a reliable assessment of eligibility and methodological quality.","[22819248, 23842561, 22270279, 19423093, 1986975, 23984345, 9848307, 22230112, 8566249, 15817589, 11821289, 11427164, 23362326, 11405553, 9688246, 18311079, 15104227, 25439837, 19260859, 15866595, 14748845, 12906167, 1633891, 12615822, 15890727, 23833592, 11383925, 19300397, 17234676, 11937115, 22859507, 3471532, 23545836, 3169631, 20007161, 25449831, 20153468, 24861131, 22562031, 12372448, 2358092, 2704505, 16816071, 23670949, 23118427, 19631319, 3422132, 17611835, 18555226, 20423864, 10458545, 8137963, 8416469, 16940291, 3480690, 18554596, 8504702, 23545719, 8526993, 17845208, 2565317, 16433829, 2313144, 3595900, 23850516, 9740457, 12594002, 19023580, 1535659, 17506483, 17959888, 25134278, 11841847, 12445988, 17922463, 18206876, 2260752, 16708809, 6759000, 25599037, 16759924, 15837658, 18295214, 19302738, 8097504, 15136083, 23816286, 8816615, 23171686, 9627304, 3494842, 8988701, 2457518, 24746440, 25551970, 17997748, 21392744, 15294374, 22852007, 24383664, 23461865, 9853882, 11883280, 20003789, 1718784, 17688616, 17296185, 2298309, 19694644, 17582674, 16359969, 3895994, 11821086, 17766605, 10360259, 18334925, 17207800, 19230876, 14998974, 14688178, 23079773, 19088375, 19917115, 23131769, 2676640, 2332066, 15212673, 6422368, 8473439, 21083865, 20480172, 23019301, 22930151, 15866120, 15218003, 16008885, 2533779, 23371435, 2867057, 22214964, 9130910, 15188832, 8543110, 12871881, 12871882, 24771894, 3457709, 10360920, 24520470, 17289049, 17482609, 10968355, 15715540, 21827658, 22348900, 21986120, 1521645, 8906091, 8752248, 17624340, 8894323, 25864257, 19230253, 15940796, 3467595, 19549703, 25118488, 21715015, 22065163, 16612709, 1834843, 24213016, 24702902, 16208475, 17086305, 18298054, 16499933, 12870230, 22713164, 16522409, 22563871, 11953158, 17261287, 18456668, 18549691, 22736326, 7884754, 3743793, 24155090, 8641484, 23799909, 12538037, 12372465, 12372468, 11864662, 8349177, 3781023, 2446822, 21136944, 1991544, 8012438, 11163823, 1492582, 16674956, 2973420, 3465595, 20172870, 9436699, 20339793, 8879358, 16190409, 9003095, 11963839, 24533749, 8671419, 24219598, 19298741, 20945013, 24648304, 16045019, 17482181, 17062580, 12919890, 25446542, 23544741, 15893866, 10433073, 16046047, 20512287, 19821100, 25366587, 2924650, 7657768, 17077107, 10902797, 19324352, 11526786, 11526785, 10994636, 21923475, 1565359, 9201878, 18555242, 3475378, 25673457, 8059614, 3165507, 638091, 8839140, 25218120, 11247641, 8566251, 18069114, 6795952, 3168208, 21968488, 7979562, 2245945, 23769549, 19232412, 12846675, 16708823, 2462793, 2030870, 17336977, 24326257, 18325521, 24889795, 19855902, 8595131, 16750201, 16712848, 15051037, 16055459, 7650148, 7825806, 18281042, 7650145, 23203215, 9173649, 18635170, 8401682, 24813083, 17706208, 2423378, 8987950, 9764347, 19022433, 14505752, 22426487, 3475234, 2801831, 9176444, 17602688, 24488583, 11889169, 22568880, 1354210, 18000171, 22416010, 21150162, 12566749, 3458595, 2030493, 18314105, 16128129, 11438377, 12009362, 24050030, 22158085, 11776169, 10224799, 15774086, 9222806, 20872572, 15820792, 15833103, 14748838, 24641675, 22392313, 19050323, 10920309, 21880316, 7926125, 24592108, 9251951, 1531465, 24889313, 8178769, 24440563, 23001777, 8329104, 8329105, 25006484, 24960545, 8385848, 23321214, 2910718, 23929199, 8082430, 11526790, 11775897]","[23842561, 22270279, 1986975, 9848307, 8566249, 11821289, 9688246, 18311079, 14748845, 12615822, 15890727, 23833592, 17234676, 11937115, 22859507, 23545836, 20007161, 24861131, 22562031, 12372448, 23118427, 19631319, 17611835, 8137963, 17845208, 16433829, 9740457, 19023580, 25134278, 12445988, 17922463, 18206876, 2260752, 16708809, 18295214, 17997748, 21392744, 22852007, 23461865, 9853882, 20003789, 17688616, 19694644, 17582674, 11821086, 17766605, 10360259, 18334925, 19230876, 14998974, 23131769, 2676640, 21083865, 20480172, 23019301, 22930151, 15866120, 15218003, 2533779, 15188832, 12871881, 24520470, 17289049, 15715540, 21827658, 8752248, 8894323, 15940796, 19549703, 22065163, 16612709, 1834843, 22713164, 22563871, 18456668, 22736326, 7884754, 8641484, 12538037, 8349177, 3781023, 11163823, 1492582, 16190409, 9003095, 24219598, 17062580, 23544741, 20512287, 25366587, 11526785, 18555242, 25218120, 8566251, 18069114, 2245945, 16708823, 24326257, 24889795, 19855902, 15051037, 7650145, 23203215, 18635170, 8401682, 24813083, 17706208, 2423378, 8987950, 22426487, 24488583, 11889169, 18000171, 12009362, 10224799, 15774086, 15820792, 24641675, 22392313, 19050323, 24592108, 24440563, 23001777, 8329104, 23321214, 2910718, 8082430]"
CD012216,18F PET with florbetapir for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),"To determine the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of 18F-florbetapir as the index test for detecting participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at time of performing the test who would clinically progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), or other forms of non-ADD, or any form of dementia at follow-up.",The index test of this SR was the 18F-florbetapir biomarker test. We used the criteria and cut-off values for test positivity as reported in the included studies. We considered positivity for 18F-florbetapir Aβ scan uptake and retention exceeding a certain threshold.,"To determine the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of 18F-florbetapir as the index test for detecting participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at time of performing the test who would clinically progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), or other forms of non-ADD, or any form of dementia at follow-up. Secondary objectives To investigate the heterogeneity of the DTA in the included studies, by evaluating the spectrum of people, referral centres, clinical criteria of MCI, 18F-florbetapir techniques, reference standards used, duration of follow-up, aspects of study quality, and conflicts of interest.","The reference standard was the progression to the target conditions evaluated by a physician with expertise in the dementia field (preferably, a geriatrician, psychiatrist, or neurologist). For the purpose of this SR, we accepted several definitions of ADD. We included studies that applied the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria (McKhann 1984), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria (APA 1987; APA 1994), and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-10) criteria for ADD. Notably, different iterations of these standards may not be directly comparable over time (e.g. APA 1987 versus APA 1994). Moreover, the validity of the diagnoses may vary with the degree or manner in which the criteria have been operationalised (e.g. individual clinician versus algorithm versus consensus determination). We considered all these issues when we interpreted the results. Similarly, we accepted differing clinical definitions of other dementias. For Lewy body dementia, the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2005); for frontotemporal dementia, the Lund criteria (Boxer 2005; Brun 1994; Neary 1998), the DSM criteria (APA 1987; APA 1994), the ICD criteria (ICD-10), or the International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium (Rascovsky 2011); and for vascular dementia, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherché et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria (Román 1993), the DSM criteria (APA 1987; APA 1994), or the ICD criteria (ICD-10). The time interval over which progression from MCI to ADD (or other forms of dementia) occurs is very important. We used one year as the minimum period of delay in the verification of the diagnosis (the time between the assessment at which a diagnosis of MCI is made and the assessment at which the diagnosis of dementia is made).",There were three target conditions in this SR: Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) (progression from MCI to ADD). Any other forms of dementia (progression from MCI to any other forms of non-ADD). Any form of dementia (progression from MCI to any form of dementia).,"Participants recruited and clinically classified as having MCI at time of performing the test were eligible for inclusion. We established the diagnosis of MCI using the Petersen criteria or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen 1999; Petersen 2004; Winblad 2004), the criteria included in the Matthews study (Matthews 2008), CDR = 0.5 (CDR structured interviews collects information from both the collateral source and the subject regarding memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care, where the range of possible scores varies from none = 0 point to severe = 3 points) (Morris 1993), the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) core clinical criteria (Albert 2011), or a combination. We excluded studies that included people with MCI possibly caused by any of the following: Current or a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Central nervous system (CNS) trauma (e.g. subdural hematoma), tumour, or infection. Other neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases). Regarding Parkinson's disease, many of the studies specifically excluded Parkison's disease patients from the group with mild cognitive impairment. This specific group of patients is complex in both regards to defining neuropathology and in determination of functional decline. For these reasons, this group of patients needs to be addressed in specific studies.","We included longitudinal studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as outlined below, at time of performing the 18F-florbetapir Aβ scan and a reference standard (see Index tests and Reference standards below). We obtained the results at the follow-up of the studies. These studies had to employ delayed verification of progression to dementia and were sometimes labelled as 'delayed verification cross-sectional studies' (Bossuyt 2008; Knottnerus 2002). We included case-control studies when they incorporated a delayed verification design. This occurred in the context of a cohort study, so these studies were invariably diagnostic-nested case-control studies.","[25482269, 24176981, 25822737, 25745091, 25541191, 25840980, 26199870, 28024995, 25356425, 26923024, 26968515, 27662288, 25681451, 26422359, 23164550]",[23164550]
CD012281,Combination of the non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of endometriosis,To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of any combination of non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal and/ or ovarian or deep infiltrating) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. The combined tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery as well as triage tests which would assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.,"We assessed any combination of non-invasive tests for endometriosis comprising of more than one test modality. This included the combinations of blood, endometrial, urine and imaging tests with or without clinical parameters, such as pre-defined examination findings, specific symptoms or characteristics (e.g. length of menstrual cycle). The assessed index tests are presented in Table 2. The panel of biomarkers from the same single category (e.g. several blood biomarkers or combination of imaging methods) was assessed in the relevant review on the topic and are presented separately in other reviews from this series. The studies that solely assessed specific technical aspects, qualitative description of lesion appearance or interobserver variability of the index tests without reporting the data on diagnostic performance were excluded from the review. When the evaluated biomarker(s) showed differential expression between the groups of women with and without endometriosis, the publication was considered only if the data were reported with sufficient detail for the construction of 2 x 2 contingency tables. However, when the contingency tables were not available because the expression level of index test did not significantly differ between the groups and the inclusion criteria were otherwise met, we made a critical appraisal and presented the study in the descriptive part of the review. Thus, we evaluated the adequately designed studies that identified biomarkers without diagnostic value, as they provide information that is likely to focus future research on other more clinically useful biomarkers.This methodology also identified biomarkers that were associated with endometriosis in some but not other studies. We did not include evaluations of screening or predictive accuracy tests in this review. We considered the diagnostic performance of an index test to be high when the test reached the criteria for a replacement test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 0.94 with specificity of equal or greater than 0.79) or triage test (sensitivity of equal or greater than 0.95 with specificity of equal or greater than 0.50 or vice versa) or approached these criteria (diagnostic estimates within 0.05 of the set thresholds). We considered all other diagnostic estimates to be low.","Primary objectives To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of any combination of non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal and/ or ovarian or deep infiltrating) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. The combined tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery as well as triage tests which would assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis. Secondary objectives To investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of combined non-invasive test for endometriosis. Potiential sources of heterogeneity include: characteristics of the study population: age (adolescents versus later reproductive years); clinical presentation (subfertility, pelvic pain, ovarian mass, asymptomatic women); stage of disease (rASRM classification system); geographic location of study; histological confirmation in conjunction with laparoscopic visualisation compared to laparoscopic visualisation alone; changes in technology over time: year of publication; modifications applied to conventional laboratory techniques; methodological quality: differences in the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) evaluation (Table 3), including a) low versus unclear or high risk; b) consecutive versus non-consecutive enrolment; c) blinding of surgeons to the results of index tests; Table 3.

Yes If inclusion/exclusion criteria were presented and all women with suspected endometriosis were included, with an exception for those who a) had a history of medical conditions or were on medical therapy that would have potentially interfered with interpretation of index test (e.g. malignancy, pregnancy, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, treatment with hormonal or immunomodulator substances); b) refused to participate in the study; or c) were unfit for surgery No If the study excluded the participants based on education level, psychosocial factors, genetic testing or phenotype or excluded participants with any co-morbidities commonly present in general population, including a population that could have undergone a testing for endometriosis in clinical setting (hypertension, asthma, obesity, benign gastro-intestinal or renal disease, etc) Unclear If the study did not provide clear definition of the selection (inclusion/exclusion) criteria and 'no' judgement was not applicable Signalling question 3 Was a 'two-gate' design avoided? Yes If the study had a single set of inclusion criteria, defined by the clinical presentation (i.e. only participants in whom the target condition is suspected) - a ‘single-gate design’. No If the study had more than one set of inclusion criteria in respect to clinical presentation (i.e. participants suspected of target condition and participants with alternative diagnosis in whom the target condition would not be suspected in clinical practice) - a 'two-gate' study design Unclear If it was unclear whether a 'two-gate design' was avoided or not Risk of bias Could the selection of patients have introduced bias?

High We excluded the studies where participants did not undergo surgery for diagnosis of endometriosis, therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'high concern' Low Considering the inclusion criteria, all the studies were classified as 'low concern', therefore all the included studies were classified as 'low concern', unless 'unclear' judgement was applicable Unclear Only studies were laparoscopy/ laparotomy served as a reference test were included; therefore none of the included studies was classified as 'unclear concern' Domain 4 - Flow and timing Description Describe any participants who did not receive the index tests or reference standard or who were excluded from the 2 x 2 table, describe the interval and any interventions between index tests and the reference standard Type of bias assessed Disease progression bias, bias of diagnostic performance due to missing data Review Question Less than 12 months interval between index test and reference standard - endometriosis may progress over the time, so we had chosen an arbitrary time interval of '12' months as an acceptable time interval between the index test and surgical confirmation of diagnosis Informaton collected Time interval between index test and reference standard, withdrawals (overall number of reported and if were explained) Signalling question 1 Was there an appropriate interval between index test (sample collection) and reference standard? Yes If time interval was reported and was less than 12 months No We excluded all the studies where time interval was longer than 12 months, therefore none of the included studies were classified as 'no' for this item Unclear if time interval was not stated clearly, but authors description allowed to assume that the interval was reasonably short Signalling question 2 Did all patients receive the same reference standard? Yes If all participants underwent laparoscopy/laparotomy as a reference standard. Considering the inclusion criteria, all the studies were classified as 'yes' for this item, as anticipated No If all participants did not undergo surgery or had alternative reference standard or if only a subset of participants had surgery as reference standard, but the information on this population was not available in isolation Unclear If this information was unclear. Considering the inclusion criteria, none of the included studies were classified as 'unclear' for this item Signalling question 3 Were all patients included in the analysis? Yes If all the participants were included in the analysis or if the participants were excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria prior to execution of index test or if the withdrawals were less than 5% of the enrolled population (arbitrary selected cut-off) No If any participants were excluded from the analysis because of un interpretable results, inability to undergo either index test or reference standard or unclear reasons Unclear If this information was unclear Risk of bias Could the patient flow have introduced bias? High If 'no' classification for any of the above three questions Low If 'yes' classification for all the above three questions Unclear If 'unclear' classification for any of the above three questions and 'high risk' judgement was not applicable study design ('single-gate design' versus 'two-gate design' studies).","The reference standard was visualisation of endometriosis at surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) with or without histological confirmation, as this is currently the best available test for endometriosis. Information regarding the inter- and intra-observer correlation of the reference standard was reviewed if reported. We only included studies in which the reference test was performed within 12 months of the sample collection or imaging test, on the assumption that the disease status could change within a period of one year or longer, either naturally or as a result of treatment. We excluded studies in which the participants did not undergo the reference standard or where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for undertaking the reference standard, as this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test.","Pelvic endometriosis, defined as endometrial tissue located in the pelvic cavity: involving any of the pelvic organs, peritoneum and pouch of Douglas (POD). Three types of pelvic endometriosis were assessed. Peritoneal endometriosis, defined as endometrial deposits detected on the peritoneum covering pelvic organs, pelvic side walls or POD. Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma), defined as an ovarian cyst lined by endometrial tissue, appearing as an ovarian mass of varying size. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), defined as subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial implants, i.e. when the endometriotic implants penetrate the retroperitoneal space at a distance of 5 mm or more (Koninckx 1991). DIE may be present in multiple locations, involving either the anterior or posterior pelvic compartments, or both. We did not include certain rare types of endometriosis such as extrapelvic, bladder and ureteric endometriosis because the majority were reported in case reports or case series, and laparoscopy or laparotomy are not reliable reference standards for these conditions. We excluded the studies where diagnosis of endometriosis was not the primary outcome (e.g. malignant versus benign masses or normal versus abnormal pelvis) and the separate data for endometriosis were not available. We also excluded the studies where the findings of the index test formed the basis of selection for the reference standard, because this was likely to distort an assessment of the diagnostic value of the index test. We did include studies that recruited selected populations of women with endometriosis (i.e. those with specific rASRM stages), because there is a poor correlation between the rASRM classification and infertility or pain symptoms. Exclusion of these studies could result in a loss of potentially important diagnostic information from otherwise eligible publications. Where possible, the impact of these studies was addressed in the assessments of heterogeneity. When a study analysed a large population with a wide spectrum of endometriosis and additionally reported a subgroup analysis of the different stages of disease severity, we only considered estimates for the entire population. This is because a subgroup analysis would not directly address the review question regarding the clinical utility of the biomarker in disease detection.","Study participants included women of reproductive age (puberty to menopause) with suspected endometriosis based on clinical symptoms or pelvic examination, who undertook both the index test and reference standard. The participants were selected from populations of women undergoing abdominal surgery for the following indications: 1) clinically suspected endometriosis (pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal pelvic examination, or a combination of the above); 2) ovarian mass, regardless of symptoms; 3) a mixed group, which consists of women with suspected endometriosis/ovarian mass or women with other benign gynaecological conditions (e.g. surgical sterilisation, fibroid uterus, etc). Asymptomatic women who had an incidental finding of endometriosis at surgery performed for another indication were also included. Studies that included participants of postmenopausal age were eligible when the data for the reproductive age group was available in isolation. We excluded studies with participants that clearly would not undergo the index test in the relevant clinical situation or would not benefit from the test (e.g. women with ectopic pregnancies or acute pelvic inflammatory disease). We also excluded publications that only analysed participants with a positive index test or reference standard and did not provide data for the whole cohort.","Published peer-reviewed studies that compared the results of a combination of several testing modalities with the results obtained from a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. Studies were included if they included the following study designs. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies with the following designs. Single-gate design (studies with a single set of inclusion criteria defined by clinical presentation). All participants had clinically suspected endometriosis. Two-gate design (studies where participants are sampled from distinct populations with respect to clinical presentation). The same study includes participants with a clinical suspicion of having the target condition (e.g. women with pelvic pain) and also participants in whom the target condition is not suspected (e.g. women admitted for tubal ligation). Two-gate studies were eligible only where all cases and controls belonged to the same population with respect to the reference standard (i.e. all the participants were scheduled for laparoscopy) (Rutjes 2005). For studies on biological samples - performed on prospectively collected samples, irrespective of the actual time of the test assay. The timing of sample collection relative to surgery is important because the surgical excision of endometriotic lesions could influence biomarker expression and hence bias the results. Therefore, we only included studies where the biological sample was collected before the surgical procedure, i.e. prospectively collected. We considered to be eligible the studies performed on tissue bank samples collected from prospectively recruited, well-defined populations, which prevented the omission of valuable data from adequately designed studies. The time interval between sample collection and laboratory testing may influence test outcomes, which could be dependent on sample storage conditions and the stability of each individual biomarker during storage and freeze-thawing. This information was not readily available for most molecules, and we did not address it in this review, but we will consider it in future updates if more evidence emerges. For studies on clinical or imaging examination - performed on prospectively recruited women with the index test being completed prior to the reference standard. We did not impose limits on eligibility related to the healthcare settings where the study took place, the language of publication, the number of participants in the included studies or the number of studies that evaluated each index test. The following studies were excluded. Narrative or systematic reviews. Studies of retrospective design where the sample collection, clinical or imaging examination were performed after execution of reference test. Studies of retrospective design where the participants were selected from retrospective review of the case notes/ archived samples and information on recruitment methods or study population was not available. Case reports or case series. Studies reported only in abstract form or in conference proceedings where the full text was not available. We applied this limitation after facing substantial difficulty in obtaining the information from the abstracts, which precluded a reliable assessment of eligibility and methodological quality.","[8566251, 8097504, 19019357, 17997748, 19202143, 14556806, 21968488, 24283984, 9201878, 6422368, 24219598, 22158084, 24960545, 9050474, 25366587, 3422132, 8566249, 16708809, 15760962, 24738122, 11704113, 22348900, 17947378, 23544741, 23545836, 10863898, 24127962, 8752248, 25218120]","[8566251, 19202143, 14556806, 24283984, 22158084, 8566249, 16708809, 24738122, 23545836, 8752248]"
CD012599,First and second trimester serum tests with and without first trimester ultrasound tests for Down's syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester serum markers with and without first trimester ultrasound markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, as combinations of markers. Individual markers are described in the other reviews belonging to this suite. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity).","The following index tests were examined; nuchal translucency (NT) scanning, ADAM12, AFP, uE3,total hCG, free βhCG, Inhibin A, PAPP-A, and combinations of these markers with maternal age. Combinations without maternal age were excluded. We looked at comparisons of tests in isolation and in various combinations. All strategies included first and second trimester serum tests, and some included additional first trimester ultrasound markers. The maximum number of markers in any one test was seven, in combination with maternal age. Where tests were used in comparison we looked at the performance of test comparisons according to predicted probabilities computed using risk equations and dichotomised into high risk and low risk (and medium risk, where applicable).","The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester serum markers with and without first trimester ultrasound markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, as combinations of markers.

Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.","We considered several reference standards, involving chromosomal verification and postnatal macroscopic inspection. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are invasive chromosomal verification tests undertaken during pregnancy. They are highly accurate, but the process carries a 1% miscarriage rate, and therefore they are only used in pregnancies considered to be at high risk of Down's, or at the mother's request. All other types of testing (postnatal examination, postnatal karyotyping, birth registers and Down’s syndrome registers) are based on information available at the end of pregnancy. The greatest concern is not their accuracy, but the loss of the pregnancy to miscarriage between the serum test and the reference standard. Miscarriage with cytogenetic testing of the fetus is included in the reference standard where available. We anticipated that older studies, and studies undertaken in older women are more likely to have used invasive chromosomal verification tests in all women. Studies undertaken in younger women and more recent studies were likely to use differential verification as they often only used prenatal karyotypic testing on fetuses considered screen positive/high risk according to the screening test; the reference standard for most unaffected infants being observing a phenotypically normal baby. Although the accuracy of this combined reference standard is considered high, it is methodologically a weaker approach as pregnancies that miscarry between the index test and birth are likely to be lost from the analysis, and miscarriage is more likely to occur in Down's than normal pregnancies. We investigated the impact of the likely missing false negative results in sensitivity analyses.","Down's syndrome in the fetus due to trisomy, translocation or mosaicism.","Pregnant women up to 24 weeks' gestation confirmed by ultrasound, who had not undergone previous testing for Down’s syndrome in their pregnancy were eligible. Studies were included if the pregnant women were unselected, or if they represented groups with increased risk of Down’s syndrome, or difficulty with conventional screening tests including maternal age greater than 35 years old, multiple pregnancy, diabetes mellitus and family history of Down’s syndrome.","We included studies in which all women from a given population had one or more index test(s) compared to a reference standard. Both consecutive series and diagnostic case-control study designs were included. Randomised trials where individuals were randomised to different screening strategies and all verified using a reference standard were also eligible for inclusion. Studies in which test strategies were compared head-to-head either in the same women, or between randomised groups were identified for inclusion in separate comparisons of test strategies. Studies were excluded if they included less than five Down's syndrome cases, or more than 20% of participants were not followed up.","[9467810, 2423942, 10740204, 15961547, 12769200, 7685092,
